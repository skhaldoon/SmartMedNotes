Treatment of Unusual occurrence of Thoracic Pedunculated Osteochondroma
Abstract: The purpose of this case report is to describe the unusual occurrence of a child’s thoracic pedunculated osteochondroma, which originates from the fourth thoracic vertebra’s lamina.
Characteristics of the disease: A 7-year-old girl was referred for a back swelling assessment. The patient has been experiencing painless, gradual, atraumatic back swelling for about two years. Physical examination revealed a healthy youngster with a well-defined mass around the midline of the upper thoracic spine, measuring around 46 cm. There were no discernible clinical indications of inherited multiple exostoses. Computerized tomography and plain radiography suggested the presence of a pedunculated osteochondroma originating from the fourth thoracic vertebra’s lamina.
Intervention and result: The mass was surgically removed from the patient. The diagnosis was validated by the pathologist. After two years of follow-up, there was no sign of a radiological or clinical recurrence.
Conclusion: This report details a unique instance of a solitary pedunculated osteochondroma in a child under 10 years old that arises from the lamina of the fourth thoracic vertebra and how it was managed.

INTRODUCTION: The most frequent benign bone and cartilage tumor is osteochondroma, which typically affects the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humorous. It prefers to occur during the metaphysis of long bones.3. Osteochondromas account for 8%–9% of all bone tumors and around 35%–40% of all primary benign bone tumours.36 Many of these tumors have no symptoms and could go undetected. As a result, the incidence is most likely higher than stated.3,7 About 85% of cases of osteochondromas begin as single lesions. The remaining ones are a result of hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant condition marked by the development of several benign growths of bone covered in cartilage.1,8 Osteochondromas can develop from any zone of endochondral bone in the context of a dysplastic disease.4 The origin of these bony growths is believed to be a laterally displaced portion of the epiphyseal cartilage, which leads to dysplastic growth instead of gradual endochondral ossification.9. Osteochondromas often start growing in early childhood and stop when the epiphyses close during puberty.10 10% of solitary osteochondromas and 1% of solitary osteochondromas may malignantly develop into chondrosarcoma. If the osteochondroma becomes painful, if it grows after skeletal growth stops, or if the thickness of the cartilaginous cap is more than 2 cm in adults or 3 cm in children, malignant transformation should be ruled out.1.12 The thickness of the cap can be measured with computerized tomography (CT), ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although the most precise technique is MRI scanning.1, 6, 12 Lesions that are asymptomatic can be monitored without medical intervention, whereas those that are symptomatic require surgical excision.1. Pain, deformity, cosmesis, ongoing development, probable malignant change, and neurovascular impairment are among the indications for excision of a solitary osteochondroma.2, 3, 12, and 14 Osteochondromas come in two distinct forms: sessile and pedunculated. The slender pedicle of the pedunculated kind is oriented away from the growth plate. The broad based ones are sessile. Just 1%–4% of all osteochondromas are single bone tumors that start in the spine.3, 10, 15, and 18 Usually, they affect the cervical spine, namely the C1 and C2 vertebrae.10, 19, 20 The lumbar and thoracic spines are the next most commonly affected regions. In this report, we present a single pedunculated osteochondroma that is asymptomatic. emerging in a 7-year-old child from the lamina of the fourth thoracic (T4) vertebra. While a sizable number of osteochondroma cases have been documented in the literature, very few cases involving spine osteochondromas have been described in patients under the age of ten. Since many of the reported instances did not specify the kind of osteochondroma, it was impossible to determine the precise number of osteochondromas in the pedunculated spine.
Case Report: The orthopedic clinic was consulted for the assessment of a painless swelling in the girl’s back, age 7. The patient stated that the edema had been there for around two years and was gradually getting worse. There was no past medical history of trauma, fever, or nocturnal agony. Her family was worried about her outward look, potential psychological impact, and sometimes back pain when she slept. A physical examination revealed a youngster in good condition with a well-defined mass at the upper thoracic spine area, measuring 4 - 6 cm around the midline. There were no indications of a spinal deformity, and the mass was fixed, bone firm, contender, deep to the skin and fascia, and no adhered to the skin. There were no other palpable lumps, and there was no clinical indication of HME. The entire neurovascular assessment and the remainder of the physical examination were both normal. In addition to zones of endochondral mineralization in the marrow underneath the osteochondroma, plain radiographs and a CT scan revealed a protrusion of cortical and medullary bone relative to the cortical bone of the spinous process of the T4 vertebra. The bone marrow of the nearby bone was in close proximity to the medullary section of the pedunculated osteochondroma. Following a discussion with the parents regarding the available treatment choices, surgical excision was selected, and informed consent was acquired. A posterior midline incision was used to approach the tumor, which was then entirely excised, including the cartilaginous cap, without causing any damage to the T4 vertebra’s lamina or spinous process. the lamina, interspinous ligament, spinous process, or supraspinous ligament. Pathologically, as shown in Figure 4, the lesion was composed of several irregularly shaped dome-shaped structures with a vague capsule and a hyaline cartilage cap measuring 3 mm that was continuous with bony trabeculae. The cartilage cap features were consistent with osteochondroma, and the bony stalk contained elements of normal marrow. A two-year follow up revealed no evidence of a radiological or clinical recurrence.
Discussion: Osteochondromas primarily affect the long bones; it is uncommon for them to originate in the vertebral column (1%– 4% of cases),4,21, 22. With or without protrusion into the spinal canal, the most common location of vertebral osteochondromas is in an eccentric position inside the neural arch.23 It is rare for an osteochondroma to extend intraspinally. As a result, affected individuals hardly ever exhibit neurological symptoms.24 Depending on the size of the lesion, a decompression laminectomy or hemi laminectomy is the most common surgical treatment for spinal column osteochondromas, which typically originate dorsally or dorasolaterally.25 Development in tandem with HME is more typical and has been covered in detail in earlier articles.21, 26, and 28 For a single osteochondroma, the typical age of clinical manifestation, encompassing all spinal levels, is approximately 30 years and HME for twenty years.28 It is still unclear what causes solitary osteochondroma and HME pathogenesis. Despite making up 40% of the vertebrae, the thoracic spine was the location of only 26%–28% of all spinal osteochondromas in the reviews of osteochondroma published by Albrecht et al.10 and Roblot et al.11. Clinical symptoms associated with osteochondromas typically appear during growing in the second or third decade of life. Roblot et al. reported four occurrences of spinal solitary osteochondroma in children under the age of ten, all of which were in the cervical spine and all of which were in males. They also reported one case of HME in children under the age of ten, which was also in the cervical spine. Brastianos et al.’s review articles on isolated thoracic osteochondromas. Only one case under the age of ten was recorded by Roblot et al. and Khosla et al. It was inextricably linked to the lamina (presumably sessile).2, 11, 19, These articles did not specify the type of osteochondroma. One case of a massive cervical pedunculated osteochondroma of the cervical spine in an 8-year-old child with HME was reported by Rao and Jakheria.29 The tumor in this case, which affected a 7-year-old child, originated from the posterior part of the T4 vertebra. This makes it an unusual case. The patient’s psychological state was enhanced and her symptoms were fully resolved through surgery without compromising the spine’s essential anatomical integrity.
Conclusion: In summary, distinguishing between a sessile and pedunculated osteochondroma in the spine is crucial due to the sessile type’s inseparability, the need for partial lamina and spinous process removal for full tumor excision, and the increased risk of neurological complications. The posterior spinal element is not harmed in the separable and en bloc excision of the pedunculated kind.
How to do hip arthroplasty
Abstract:
Background: Acetabulum fractures can cause posttraumatic arthritis even after they have been fixed, making them a complex and challenging condition to manage. In this patient group, total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been the most often done operation for posttraumatic arthritis problems. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the complications and functional outcomes of converting to total hip arthroscopy (THA) for posttraumatic arthritis following acetabular fracture. Patients and techniques: A mean follow-up period of 3.7 years (range: 2–5 years) was observed for 49 patients. Four occurrences of sciatic nerve palsy were among the complications; all of them had suffered trauma during the first procedure. Two instances had two stages of surgery due to infection, which was indicated by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Following THA infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, one case was treated using a one-stage infection strategy based on protein and frozen section samples that were supplied intraoperatively with a 10 neutrophil/high-power field. We employed cages in two cases, the Girdle stone surgery for severe infections and uncontrolled diabetes, and uncommented cups in 47 cases. Findings: At the last follow-up, the modified Hip Harris Score mean improved from 47 (31–66) before to the revision to 89 (79–95). At the final follow-up, the average pain component for both Western Ontario and McMaster Universities increased from 7–20 to 0–11. Absence of dislocation, pulmonary thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis, fresh nerve damage, and heterotopic ossification. In conclusion, reasonable pain reduction and functional improvement can result from the conversion to THA following posttraumatic arthritis in acetabular fracture patients. Keywords: acetabular fracture, conversion total hip arthroplasty, posttraumatic arthritis, internal fixation.
Introduction: Complex acetabular fracture has not been clearly explored in the literature. Its utility was limited to associated fracture patterns based on the Letournel classification by some authors. However, others have used it for various types of fractures, including processions of the acetabulum. Patterns like this are more demanding in management and utilization.1 Acetabular fractures are challenging and difficult to manage. They can result in posttraumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis of femoral head, or both. Despite the fact that open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) reduces the risk of posttrau- matic arthritis, the risk cannot be completely eliminated.2 Furthermore, ORIF failure in fracture of acetabulum ranges between 12% and 57% in different investigations. In case of posttraumatic arthritis and its adverse effects, total hip arthroplasty (THA) might be a feasible resolving proce- dure.7 The conversion of acetabular fracture to arthroplasty leads to different survival rates. Regarding the frequency of acetabular fracture in the elderly, it can be predicted that number of patients in this age group undergoing THA will increase.1,3,4,8–10 Post-acetabular fracture THA poses different challenges for orthopedic surgeons, including residual pelvis deformities, bone loss in the acetabulum, infections, osteonecrosis, heterotopic ossification, maintained metalwork, sciatic nerve palsy, and other problems encountered in acetabular element fixations in the long term.8 Indication for performing an acute THA in young people with concurrent femoral head and acetabular difficulties is severe non reconstruct able comminution, and in geriatric patients, the indication is severe bony comminution. Outcomes of THA for posttraumatic acetabular fracture consist of good pain relief and functional developments.10,11 In a large-scale population meta-analysis, 3,670 acetabular fractures were included and the most common long-term postsurgical ORIF complication was posttraumatic arthritis (20%). The rate of osteonecrosis of femoral head was 5.6%.12 In other investigations, the incidence of posttraumatic arthritis was between 10% and 60% in some series. The incidence of femoral head osteonecrosis was between 3% and 53%.13 In one study, the incidence of conversion of ORIF to THA during and after 5 years of first treatment was 11%.14 Fractures of acetabulum might grow the risk of post- traumatic degenerative arthritis and THA. Previous investigations revealed that adverse events related to conversion of ORIF to THA are higher in comparison with primary THA.15 Predisposing factors in conversion arthroplasty failure are comminution and initial displacement, femoral head defect, fracture of femoral head or neck, and crush in anterolateral or posterior portion of acetabulum. It is suggested to perform THA immediately when patients encounter these situations after ORIF.16,17 The problems associated with performing converted THA such patients are poor bone supply, damaged tissue, higher risk of infection, and presence of previous implant.8 In the current study, the researchers assessed short-term functional outcomes and the associated complications in posttraumatic arthritis patients who had undergone THA after ORIF.
Patients and Methods: This study examined the outcomes of patients at Tehran, Iran’s Erfan and Milad hospitals who were eligible for conversion from posttraumatic arthritis to THA by observational prospective analysis. When they were injured, the age range of the participants was 17 to 68 years old, with 43 males and 6 females. Between 1998 and 2015, all patients underwent surgery to convert their posttraumatic arthritis from internal fixation of an acetabular fracture to total hip arthroscopy (THA). It is noteworthy to emphasize that the conversion of THA is frequently required due to the factors associated with the failure of fixation following posttraumatic arthritis. Following a consistent methodology, all patients who met the criteria for conversion surgery underwent an investigation lasting between 3.2 and 17.1 years on average. Posttraumatic arthritis followed acetabular fracture in all patients. fracture and required THA as a result of excruciating pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility. Every attempt was made to achieve a safe and specific distance from the prior incision. All procedures were performed utilizing a direct lateral (Hardinge) approach with the patient in the lateral position and a standard-length incision. Under general anesthesia, patients had surgery using a standard protocol with some slight modifications. A plane was created at a distance of 1-2 cm on either side between the subcutaneous tissues and the gluteal fascia, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were incised in a single line. After dividing the gluteus medius and minimums, a capsulotomy was carried out. The plates were left in place during THA, and the only screws in the joints or were removed or taken out by a milling tool on the reamer path. After the posttraumatic arthritis issues developed, this was not the first operation. Thus, it is indisputable that press-fitting from the cup and reaming the acetabulum require a significant level of accuracy. If there was a possibility of infection or if the acetabular implants were becoming loose or affected, the researchers removed them. Osteotomies were used in certain instances to remove the plates. Throughout the patient evaluation, every other procedure was carried out in compliance with the established guidelines.18 The Girdle stone surgery was utilized in 1 case by the researchers to treat severe infections and uncontrolled diabetes; cages were used in 2 cases, and uncommented cups were used in 47 cases. The metal bearing surface was extremely cross-linked polyethylene, with the exception of five juvenile cases where the senior author combined highly cross-linked polyethylene with third-generation delta ceramic. It is important to note that X-rays were taken of each patient during the procedure, and that after it was finished, an abduction pillow was placed between the legs. Additionally, prophylactic antibiotics were started in the operating room 30 minutes before to the incision and repeated twice more. Intravenous transfusion of 15 mg/ kg tranexamic acid was used to reduce bleeding during the procedure. All patients also received enoxaparin for a month as a prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and indomethacin-SR 75 mg was administered daily for 6 weeks to treat heterotopic ossification.18
Examining data statistically: Utilizing descriptive statistical methods, the mean SD of quantitative. The variables before and after the procedure were compared using a paired t-test, and the results were assessed using a linear regression test. The software SPSS (19.0 for Windows; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all analyses. P-values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant.
Declaration of Ethics: The Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences, Tehran branch’s ethical committee oversaw all ethical concerns pertaining to patient information and procedures, and ethical statements were authorized by the committee. In compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, each patient was required to fill out a written informed consent form before they could take part in the study.
Outcomes: For each participant, a clinical and radiological evaluation was conducted following the conversion process. Prior to the operation, the modified Hip Harris Score (MHHS) was recorded. six months following the procedure and at the two-year follow-up. In the current study, none of the patients experienced dislocation, DVT or pulmonary thromboembolism, heterotopic ossification, new nerve injury (only in 4 cases of preoperative sciatic nerve injury, tendon transfer was performed 6 months postoperatively), or new nerve injury. Two patients required reoperation: one was an acute infection that was managed with a one-stage revision, and the other involved a serious infection and sepsis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and an advanced age of the patient that Girdle stone addressed.
Radiographic Assessment: After internal fixation, all subjects received THA for posttraumatic arthritis, with an average follow-up period of 6.2 years (ranging from 3.2 to 17.1 years). Simple and complicated fractures are the two types of fractures that are typically seen in acetabular fractures. The majority of patients received plate treatment initially for complicated fractures. Between three and seventeen years following the first treatment, all of them experienced posttraumatic arthritis following ORIF and required total hip arthroplasty (THA) as a result of complications from their previous acetabula fracture procedure.
Difficulties: Four occurrences of sciatic nerve palsy were among the complications; all of them had suffered trauma during the first procedure. Due to infection, which was indicated by high levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein as well as by frozen section samples (confirmed by >10 polymorph nuclear cells/high-power field), two cases underwent two stages of surgery; one patient developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after THA.followup after surgery Six months after the conversion surgery, the MHHS was used to assess its effects on pain relief and practical progress, even though it had been recorded for every patient during the 2-year final follow-up. The results showed that, six months after THA, the MHHS had improved from 47 (31–66) prior to the procedure to 89 (79–95). Furthermore, at the last follow-up, the average pain score for McMaster and Western Ontario Universities decreased from 15 (7–20) to 4 (0–11). Four patients from the current study that were treated are shown in Figures 1-4.
Discussion: Fractures of the proximal side of the femur are increasing in frequency as the population ages.19 Additionally, THA is the most advantageous technique in orthopedics and one of the greatest practices in modern orthopedic surgery. The procedures are carried out for various reasons, and the indications for post-traumatic arthritis are the same as those for any patient with a destructed hip disorder. These include unbearable pain, trouble performing daily tasks, confirmed radiological signs of advanced arthritis, articular incongruity, or osteonecrosis.18 Whether simple or complex, the ORIF approach is used to treat the majority of acetabulum fractures. Orthopedic doctors use THA when patients have difficulties associated to post-traumatic arthritis in order to get the desired results. A precise reoperation is a crucial component that might enhance the likelihood of surgical success. However, it’s also necessary to carry out a surgery in a proper and conventional manner: The primary focus of many investigations was THA of acetabular fractures following unsuccessful internal fixation. 32 patients receiving THA after a failed dynamic hip screw were evaluated by Hamad et al. in 2023. fixation and discovered just one dislocation and one per prosthetic fracture. At the end follow-up, 78% of patients had good–excellent clinical results.23 The rate of osteoporotic fractures, such as those of the pelvis and acetabulum, will rise as the population ages. Compared to younger cases with similar injuries, management of senior patients with acetabular fractures is more debatable. In these cases, prevention of posttraumatic arthritis and THA is still the best way to reduce the need for revision arthroplasty. In the elderly population, arthroplasty is frequently used to treat proximal femur fractures and is However, most surgeons who perform acute total hip arthroplasty (THA) for older acetabular fractures do not permit immediate weight bearing following surgery. As such, the debate over the most effective way to treat these difficult fractures continues. Four therapy options have been identified so far: ORIF, restricted open reduction and percutaneous screw fixation, acute THA, and non-surgical treatment with early mobilization. However, the precise indications and advantages of any treatment are still unknown. The development of cement less fixation and implant designs has significantly improved clinical outcomes, especially on the acetabular side.24, 25 The current investigation had certain shortcomings. The sample size was minimal during the study period and the study did not include a specific age group for analysis.
Conclusion: The current study’s findings, taken together with a slightly higher rate of intraoperative complications, indicate that the conversion of posttraumatic arthritis following acetabular internal fixation to total hip artharthoplasty (THA) is a safe option that yields good functional results and is clinically successful without increasing the risk of complications. On the other hand, it is imperative to alert patients to the risk of only partial postoperative relief from groin pain. Appropriate preoperative planning is likely to increase patient satisfaction and decrease discomfort, and raising awareness of common complications may enhance results. A large-scale study involving age-diverse subgroups is advised in order to improve the validity and generalizability of the findings.
Hip osteoarthritis
Hip osteoarthritis is a condition that many people have heard of but often do not fully understand. It is a problem that affects the joints in your hips, causing pain and stiffness. While it is commonly seen in older adults, it can actually affect people of all ages.
Let’s explore what hip osteoarthritis is, why it happens, and what symptoms to look out for.
Causes of Hip Osteoarthritis
Hip osteoarthritis develops when the hip cartilage tissues wear down over time. Several factors can contribute to the development of hip osteoarthritis, and understanding these causes is essential for effective prevention and management.
Let us explore the primary causes in more detail:
Age-Related Wear and Tear
One of the most common causes of hip osteoarthritis is the natural aging process. As we age, the cartilage cushions the hip joint may gradually wear down. This age-related wear and tear can lead to the development of osteoarthritis.
It is important to note that while aging is a significant risk factor, hip osteoarthritis can occur at any age.
Genetic Factors
Genetics can play a role in the development of hip osteoarthritis. If you have a family history of osteoarthritis, you may be genetically predisposed to the condition.
Certain genetic traits can affect the structure and stability of your joints, increasing the likelihood of osteoarthritis development.
Obesity and Lifestyle Factors
Carrying excess weight places additional stress on the hip joints. The more weight the hips have to support, the greater the risk of developing osteoarthritis.
Additionally, a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity can contribute to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, further increasing the risk.
Injuries and Joint Damage
Past injuries or trauma to the hip joint can increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis, even if the injury occurred years ago.
Fractures, dislocations, or other joint injuries may:
Lead to long-term damage and joint instability
Contribute to the development of osteoarthritis
Overuse and Repetitive Motion
Engaging in activities or occupations that involve repetitive hip movements can lead to overuse and strain on the joint.
Athletes or individuals with physically demanding jobs may be at a higher risk of hip osteoarthritis due to the constant stress placed on the hip joint.
Congenital Abnormalities
In some cases, congenital abnormalities or structural issues present from birth can predispose individuals to hip osteoarthritis.
These abnormalities can affect the alignment and stability of the hip joint, leading to increased wear and tear over time.
Understanding these causes allows individuals to take proactive steps, such as:
Maintaining a healthy weight
Staying physically active
Seeking medical attention for injuries
Early intervention and lifestyle adjustments can make a significant difference in managing this condition effectively.
Symptoms of Hip Osteoarthritis
Hip osteoarthritis typically begins with subtle warning signs that may be easy to dismiss. Early symptoms often include:
Stiffness: You may notice stiffness in your hip joint, especially in the morning or after prolonged periods of inactivity.
Discomfort: A mild, nagging discomfort in the hip region is common. It might feel like a dull ache.
Reduced Range of Motion: You may find it slightly harder to move your hip as freely as before, particularly when trying to rotate or flex.
Progression of Symptoms
As hip osteoarthritis progresses, these initial warning signs can intensify. You may experience:
Pain: The discomfort can evolve into more pronounced pain. This pain might interfere with your daily activities and sleep.
Limping: To alleviate pain, you might start to favor one leg over the other, resulting in a noticeable limp.
Crepitus: You could hear or feel a grinding or popping sensation in the hip joint when moving.
Loss of Flexibility: The range of motion in your hip may become significantly restricted, making simple tasks challenging.
Impact on Daily Life
The impact of hip osteoarthritis on daily life can be substantial. Chronic pain and reduced mobility can affect your ability to perform everyday activities, such as:
Walking: You may find it painful to take even short walks.
Climbing Stairs: Going up and down stairs can become a challenging task.
Sitting and Standing: Transitions between sitting and standing can be uncomfortable.
It is important to recognize these symptoms early on and seek medical attention to prevent the condition from worsening.
Understanding these signs can help individuals take proactive steps toward managing hip osteoarthritis effectively.
The knee is the biggest joint in the body. Its main function is to absorb and support most of the body’s weight as you move and perform various physical activities. The knee joint is also the most susceptible to injury and dysfunction, making it crucial to prioritize its care and maintenance.
In managing sudden or chronic knee pain, proper weight management is essential. Excess weight increases the risk of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. This health risk can lead to more severe and chronic conditions that affect your quality of life over time.
Here’s everything you need to know about the connection between knee pain and weight management and what steps you can take to manage your weight.
The Connection Between Knee Pain and Weight
Knee pain can be traced back to sports injuries and overuse issues. Among these causes is osteoarthritis, or cartilage degeneration between the bones. Arthritis is a common joint condition affecting any part of the body, including the knee. It can also happen at any age. Arthritis is a prevalent condition that affects over 50 million adults and 300,000 children in the US.
Obesity, on the other hand, is also not a new problem in the US. In fact, according to the CDC, over 73.6% of adults over 20 in a recent survey were overweight, including those who had obesity. Excessive body fat can negatively impact your overall body’s systems – including your joint health.
Obesity is also among the major risks for developing osteoarthritis. Due to obesity, the knee joint carries more weight to support the body. However, the more weight on your joint, the more likely it is to cause wear and tear on the cartilage. This often leads to aching and swollen knee joints, eventually leading to knee pain.
Many studies have found that weight and knee pain are related factors. One study even found that people who have obesity are four to five times more likely to get knee arthritis.
However, taking control of your weight can mitigate the symptoms of knee arthritis, including knee pain. According to another recent study, losing just 10 pounds halts knee arthritis development by 50%. Losing weight can reduce knee pain and other symptoms of joint disorders by decreasing stress placed on the joint.
Solutions for Managing Knee Pain and Weight
While losing weight can be a difficult task and an overwhelming lifestyle change, one of its benefits includes managing your knee pain and stopping it from worsening.
There are many exercises and physical therapy options to manage knee pain and reduce weight. Low-impact exercises such as swimming and cycling for a period every week can be beneficial in reducing knee pain. A physical therapist can guide you through flexibility and mobility exercises to take the pressure off your knee joint and reduce knee pain.
Maintaining a healthy weight goes hand in hand with maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Evaluating your diet and seeking your healthcare provider for specific dietary recommendations based on your current health status can help manage weight.
Medication to manage weight is also used along with other treatments. A discussion with your healthcare provider can help you find the right medication for your case. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also support your weight management plan by managing your stress and helping you have a positive outlook during your weight loss journey.
It’s essential to remember that every step towards weight management counts, no matter how small they are. While weight management journeys can take a long time, their effects can greatly reduce the risk of developing knee pain and improve your overall health.
What is a Kyphoplasty & How Can It Help Me?
A minimally invasive spine procedure that is being performed with increased frequency across the orthopedic community is kyphoplasty. This procedure is meant solely for those who have a compression fracture in one or more vertebrae in the spine. With the help of a balloon, the act of relieving chronic back pain due to a vertebral compression fracture has revolutionized.
What is a vertebral fracture?
It is important to know that the spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae. A vertebral compression fracture is a result of a break or crack in one of these bones. Typically, this happens to vertebrae that have degenerated over time due to aging and the deterioration of the vertebrae. A vertebral compression fracture can also be the result of an accident, such as a car crash. There are more than 700,000 vertebral compression fractures a year in America, so it is important to see a physician for a prompt diagnosis.
What are the symptoms of a compression fracture?
Sudden and severe pain in your back
Limited spinal movement
Increased pain while walking
Decreased pain when laying down
Loss of height
Deformity (kyphosis, or round back)
What is a Kyphoplasty Procedure?
Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that can treat a vertebral compression fracture. When a kyphoplasty is performed, the surgeon utilizes a continuous live x-ray called fluoroscopy. This creates a live visualization of the placement of instruments since the incision is so small. A small needle is then guided into the fractured vertebrae where the surgeon then inflates a small balloon. The balloon restores height to the collapsed vertebra. The cavity that the balloon created is then filled with surgical cement that will immediately stabilize the bone. The incisions are so small that stitches aren’t even required, just a bandage.
Who is eligible for Kyphoplasty?
Kyphoplasty is one of many treatments available for vertebral compression fractures, however, it is the only minimally invasive option. Kyphoplasty is not meant for back pain that is not caused by a vertebral compression fracture. Typically, these are what make an ideal kyphoplasty candidate:
Increased back pain due to compression fracture
Reduced ability to move and function because of the fracture
Pain is related to the fracture and no other problems

What Is Spinal Cord Injury and Its Treatment?
This article explores spinal cord injury and treatment options in detail. Health related to the spine and spinal cord is the foundation of an active, happy and peaceful life. Thus, knowing about spinal cord injuries and treatment options will definitely enrich life in multiple ways.
The Spine & The Spinal Cord
The spine is the most crucial part of the human body. It helps keep us upright. Without it, no human being would be able to sit and stand straight. Apart from this ability, the spine also protects the spinal cord.
Talking about its anatomical structure, the spine is a column of small bones called vertebrae. This column is hollow inside, a long near-vertical cavity, which is also known as a spinal cavity. Inside this cavity is the spinal cord, enclosed and suspended in spinal fluid.
The spinal cord is a cylindrical bundle of nerve tissues. This cord plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the brain and the rest of the body. The brain and the spinal cord both together are named the central nervous system.
An injury to this critical cord is called a spinal cord injury, which can lead to devastating health complications without prompt medical attention. The causes of injury are discussed below.
Causes
The spinal cord can get injured due to traumatic or non-traumatic causes.
A traumatic cause means harmful external force, for example, intense blows, accidents, falls, hits, violence etc. For non-traumatic causes, they happen internally and injure the spinal cord, for example, tumors, infections, inflammation, arthritis, disc degeneration etc.
Furthermore, a spinal cord injury can also be categorized as either primary or secondary. To understand it better, consider the following scenario.
As people age, the water content in a spinal disc reduces and thus it shrinks in size. In other words, aging dehydrates a spinal disc.
A dehydrated disc becomes more prone to herniation or damage. If a disc becomes herniated, it impinges on the nearby nerve roots, which can injure the spinal cord. If the treatment isn’t provided on time, it can lead to permanent disabilities. This is an example of a secondary spinal cord injury as a complication of the herniated disc.
Primary injuries in the spinal cord often occur due to a traumatic cause.
Symptoms
Symptoms or how a spinal cord injury affects you depends on the location and severity. These are two crucial aspects to consider in every spinal cord injury.
Location: The spinal cord runs from the head to the bottom of the waist in the spinal cavity. However, this is just a simple view. In reality, the spinal cord is also branched at each vertebral level.
Each vertebra has small cavities on either side—the spinal cord branches out to other parts of the body through these openings (cavities).
The entire spine is categorized into the following major parts, namely
Cervical Spine (The Neck Area)
Thoracic Spine (Upper-Middle Back)
Lumbar Spine (Lower Back)
Sacral Spine (The Above Part of Tailbone)
There are 7 vertebrae from C1 to C7 in the neck or the cervical spine. Similarly, Thoracic Spine is made up of 12 vertebral units, known as T1 to T12. For Lumbar Spine, there are 5 vertebrae, denoted by L1-L5. Finally, vertebrae in the sacral spine are also 5 in number and are known as S1 to S5.
Each vertebra has nerve roots branching out of its side openings to all the body parts.
If the spinal cord at the cervical level is damaged, it will affect the rest of the body down the neck or the site of injury. Likewise, if the injury is at the thoracic level, it will affect every part of the body down to the site of injury.
Thus, the location is a crucial consideration in spinal cord injury. The site of injury in the spine decides which part of the body will be affected.
Severity: Another thing is how bad the injury is. An injury can cause either the complete loss of movement and sensations or just some of them.
If a spinal cord injury is in the neck and the affected person cannot move any of their body parts down the neck, the injury is complete. Furthermore, if they can move their body just a little bit, the injury is incomplete.
Based on these two considerations (location and severity), the affected person will have the following symptoms.
Movement loss
Partial or complete loss of sensation
Problems in bowel or bladder control
Uncontrolled muscle contractions
Trouble in breathing
Intense stinging sensation
Paralysis: Based on the location of a spinal injury, there are two types of paralysis. Loss of sensations and ability to control movement from the neck to the rest of the body below, including both arms and shoulders is called quadriplegia; it is a very severe type of paralysis.
If the injury only affects the lower half of the body, it is called paraplegia.
Thus, if you have had an injury in the neck, don’t ignore or suppress the pain merely by taking painkillers. Consult a spine specialist as soon as possible. Not ensuring immediate medical care can lead to conditions of paralysis later in life.
Diagnosis
There are various ways a doctor can examine a spinal injury.
Questions & Physical Examinations: The doctor will ask questions about the cause of injury, such as if you have had an accident, etc. The doctor will try to evaluate the degree of loss of sensations and movements through physical assessments and techniques.
X-rays: This test uses X-rays to produce images of the bony parts of the body. An X-ray test can help learn about the internal conditions related to the spinal bones, which are called vertebrae. Vertebral fractures are major causes of most of the spinal cord injuries during traumatic events.
MRIs: An MRI test relies on a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed 2-D images of bones and soft tissues. This test can help diagnose the extent of spinal cord injury.
CT Scans: Like an MRI, a CT scan also helps examine the internal conditions of the bone and soft-tissue parts of the spine.
Treatment
There are two types of spinal cord injuries based on the nature of the origin. If it is caused by a traumatic event, it is called a trauma-related spinal cord injury and otherwise, non-trauma-related spinal cord injury.
Based on this distinction, treatment differs.
The doctor can treat a traumatic spinal cord injury by methods like medications, immobilization, and surgery.
Medications help with swelling, inflammation, pain and other symptoms.
Immobilizations usually achieved through traction techniques (keeping the spine immobile in one place) and support devices like splints, braces, etc., (to stabilize the injured part while the affected person is being moved).
Surgery is performed basically to relieve compressed nerves and repair damage to the surrounding structures.
If the spinal cord injury has originated from a non-traumatic cause like compression fractures due to osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease, tumors, infection, etc., the medical approach to treatment differs.
In that case, the doctor mostly focuses on preventing the injury from becoming worse and improving the quality of life with available therapies like physiotherapy, occupational therapy, mental therapies, in-home care and support.
Treatment length depends on the extent of the injury and other factors. It is crucial to receive treatment from a medical professional no matter how long it takes and how slow the situation improves or recovery seems.
Conclusion
the spine has several life-sustaining functions, including providing protection to the spinal cord. This cord facilitates communication between the brain and the rest of the body, which is also known as the central nervous system.
Thus, injuries related to the spinal cord can lead to life-threatening consequences like complete paralysis and even death in the presence of extreme complications.
Spinal cord injuries caused by trauma are a matter of medical emergency. Here, the entire focus of healthcare professionals remains on preventing the injury from becoming worse. This can be achieved through immobilization techniques and surgical interventions.
Alongside, medications and therapies are also used to work on symptoms and improve the overall quality of life. Mental health therapies might also be part of rehabilitation programmers, to help the person transition into living life with permanent disabilities with a positive outlook.
