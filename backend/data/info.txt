Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. It focuses on diagnosing, treating, and preventing disorders related to movement and structural integrity. The skeletal system consists of different types of bones, such as long bones (femur, humerus), short bones (carpals, tarsals), flat bones (sternum, scapula), and irregular bones (vertebrae). Bone healing occurs in stages: hematoma formation, fibrocartilaginous callus formation, bony callus formation, and remodeling. Fractures can be classified as open or closed, and further divided into comminuted, greenstick, stress, or pathological fractures. Proper healing requires immobilization, reduction, and in some cases, surgical fixation.

Various bone and joint disorders affect mobility and quality of life. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage wear and tear, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced joint space on X-ray. It is managed through lifestyle modifications, NSAIDs, and joint replacement in severe cases. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects synovial joints, causing inflammation, deformity, and systemic symptoms. Treatment involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics. Gout results from uric acid deposition in joints, often affecting the big toe, and is managed using colchicine, NSAIDs, and lifestyle changes. Osteoporosis leads to weakened bones due to decreased bone density and is diagnosed using a DEXA scan. Treatment includes calcium, vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonates.

Orthopedic emergencies require immediate attention to prevent complications. Open fractures, characterized by broken bones piercing the skin, increase the risk of infection and require surgical debridement and fixation. Compartment syndrome, caused by increased pressure within a closed muscle compartment, leads to ischemia and tissue necrosis if untreated; it is managed through fasciotomy. Dislocations, particularly in the shoulder and hip, require reduction and immobilization. Spinal injuries, especially in the cervical spine, can lead to paralysis and necessitate immobilization and sometimes surgical intervention.

Diagnosis of orthopedic conditions relies on clinical examination, imaging, and laboratory tests. X-rays are the primary tool for fracture assessment, while MRI is useful for soft tissue injuries and ligamentous damage. CT scans provide detailed bony anatomy, especially in complex fractures. Blood tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies, help diagnose autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid analysis assists in differentiating between infectious arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis (gout, pseudogout), and inflammatory arthritis.

Treatment in orthopedics ranges from conservative to surgical interventions. Conservative management includes rest, physiotherapy, bracing, and pharmacological treatment like NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Surgical options include internal fixation (plates, screws, intramedullary nails), external fixation, joint arthroplasty (total knee replacement, total hip replacement), and minimally invasive procedures like arthroscopy. Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in restoring function, improving strength, and preventing complications.
Orthopedics is a specialized branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The human skeleton is classified into long bones (e.g., femur, tibia), short bones (e.g., carpals, tarsals), flat bones (e.g., scapula, sternum), and irregular bones (e.g., vertebrae). Bone healing occurs in four stages: inflammation, where a hematoma forms at the fracture site; soft callus formation, where fibrocartilage develops for initial stability; hard callus formation, where woven bone replaces cartilage; and remodeling, where bone gradually strengthens and restores its original structure.

Fractures can be classified based on severity and pattern, including open (compound), closed (simple), comminuted, spiral, transverse, oblique, stress, and pathological fractures. Management depends on the type and severity, involving immobilization (cast or splint), closed reduction, or surgical fixation with plates, screws, or intramedullary nails. Common joint injuries include dislocations (shoulder, hip, knee), ligament injuries (ACL tear, MCL sprain), and meniscal tears, which are often diagnosed using MRI and managed with physiotherapy or surgery.

Orthopedic diseases include osteoarthritis, characterized by cartilage degeneration, joint pain, and stiffness, managed through NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and joint replacement. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition leading to joint deformity and systemic inflammation, requiring DMARDs and biologics for treatment. Gout results from uric acid crystal deposition, causing acute joint inflammation, typically treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, and urate-lowering therapy. Osteoporosis, a condition of decreased bone density, increases fracture risk and is diagnosed using a DEXA scan, with treatment including bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation.

Orthopedic emergencies require immediate attention to prevent complications. Open fractures increase infection risk and need surgical debridement and fixation. Compartment syndrome, caused by increased pressure within a muscle compartment, can lead to ischemia and necrosis if untreated, necessitating fasciotomy. Spinal injuries, especially in the cervical region, may cause paralysis and require immobilization or surgical stabilization. Hip fractures in elderly patients are common and often managed with hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement.

Diagnosis of orthopedic conditions relies on clinical examination, imaging, and laboratory tests. X-rays are the first-line modality for fracture assessment, while MRI is preferred for soft tissue injuries and ligament tears. CT scans provide detailed visualization of complex fractures. Blood tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP antibodies, and synovial fluid analysis, help diagnose conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and gout.

Treatment strategies in orthopedics range from conservative management to surgical intervention. Conservative methods include rest, physiotherapy, bracing, and pharmacological treatments such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Surgical approaches involve internal fixation with plates and screws, external fixation, joint arthroplasty (total knee replacement, total hip replacement), and minimally invasive procedures like arthroscopy. Post-surgical rehabilitation is crucial for restoring function, improving strength, and preventing complications.
