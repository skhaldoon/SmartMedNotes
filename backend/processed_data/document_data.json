  "Orthopedics is the branch of medicine that deals with the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles",
  "It focuses on diagnosing, treating, and preventing disorders related to movement and structural integrity",
  "The skeletal system consists of different types of bones, such as long bones (femur, humerus), short bones (carpals, tarsals), flat bones (sternum, scapula), and irregular bones (vertebrae)",
  "Bone healing occurs in stages: hematoma formation, fibrocartilaginous callus formation, bony callus formation, and remodeling",
  "Fractures can be classified as open or closed, and further divided into comminuted, greenstick, stress, or pathological fractures",
  "Proper healing requires immobilization, reduction, and in some cases, surgical fixation",
  "Various bone and joint disorders affect mobility and quality of life",
  "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage wear and tear, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced joint space on X-ray",
  "It is managed through lifestyle modifications, NSAIDs, and joint replacement in severe cases",
  "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects synovial joints, causing inflammation, deformity, and systemic symptoms",
  "Treatment involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics",
  "Gout results from uric acid deposition in joints, often affecting the big toe, and is managed using colchicine, NSAIDs, and lifestyle changes",
  "Osteoporosis leads to weakened bones due to decreased bone density and is diagnosed using a DEXA scan",
  "Treatment includes calcium, vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonates",
  "Orthopedic emergencies require immediate attention to prevent complications",
  "Open fractures, characterized by broken bones piercing the skin, increase the risk of infection and require surgical debridement and fixation",
  "Compartment syndrome, caused by increased pressure within a closed muscle compartment, leads to ischemia and tissue necrosis if untreated; it is managed through fasciotomy",
  "Dislocations, particularly in the shoulder and hip, require reduction and immobilization",
  "Spinal injuries, especially in the cervical spine, can lead to paralysis and necessitate immobilization and sometimes surgical intervention",
  "Diagnosis of orthopedic conditions relies on clinical examination, imaging, and laboratory tests",
  "X-rays are the primary tool for fracture assessment, while MRI is useful for soft tissue injuries and ligamentous damage",
  "CT scans provide detailed bony anatomy, especially in complex fractures",
  "Blood tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies, help diagnose autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis",
  "Synovial fluid analysis assists in differentiating between infectious arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis (gout, pseudogout), and inflammatory arthritis",
  "Treatment in orthopedics ranges from conservative to surgical interventions",
  "Conservative management includes rest, physiotherapy, bracing, and pharmacological treatment like NSAIDs and corticosteroids",
  "Surgical options include internal fixation (plates, screws, intramedullary nails), external fixation, joint arthroplasty (total knee replacement, total hip replacement), and minimally invasive procedures like arthroscopy",
  "Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in restoring function, improving strength, and preventing complications",
  "Orthopedics is a specialized branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders affecting the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments",
  "The human skeleton is classified into long bones (e.g., femur, tibia), short bones (e.g., carpals, tarsals), flat bones (e.g., scapula, sternum), and irregular bones (e.g., vertebrae)",
  "Bone healing occurs in four stages: inflammation, where a hematoma forms at the fracture site; soft callus formation, where fibrocartilage develops for initial stability; hard callus formation, where woven bone replaces cartilage; and remodeling, where bone gradually strengthens and restores its original structure",
  "Fractures can be classified based on severity and pattern, including open (compound), closed (simple), comminuted, spiral, transverse, oblique, stress, and pathological fractures",
  "Management depends on the type and severity, involving immobilization (cast or splint), closed reduction, or surgical fixation with plates, screws, or intramedullary nails",
  "Common joint injuries include dislocations (shoulder, hip, knee), ligament injuries (ACL tear, MCL sprain), and meniscal tears, which are often diagnosed using MRI and managed with physiotherapy or surgery",
  "Orthopedic diseases include osteoarthritis, characterized by cartilage degeneration, joint pain, and stiffness, managed through NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and joint replacement",
  "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition leading to joint deformity and systemic inflammation, requiring DMARDs and biologics for treatment",
  "Gout results from uric acid crystal deposition, causing acute joint inflammation, typically treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, and urate-lowering therapy",
  "Osteoporosis, a condition of decreased bone density, increases fracture risk and is diagnosed using a DEXA scan, with treatment including bisphosphonates, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation",
  "Orthopedic emergencies require immediate attention to prevent complications",
  "Open fractures increase infection risk and need surgical debridement and fixation",
  "Compartment syndrome, caused by increased pressure within a muscle compartment, can lead to ischemia and necrosis if untreated, necessitating fasciotomy",
  "Spinal injuries, especially in the cervical region, may cause paralysis and require immobilization or surgical stabilization",
  "Hip fractures in elderly patients are common and often managed with hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement",
  "Diagnosis of orthopedic conditions relies on clinical examination, imaging, and laboratory tests",
  "X-rays are the first-line modality for fracture assessment, while MRI is preferred for soft tissue injuries and ligament tears",
  "CT scans provide detailed visualization of complex fractures",
  "Blood tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-CCP antibodies, and synovial fluid analysis, help diagnose conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and gout",
  "Treatment strategies in orthopedics range from conservative management to surgical intervention",
  "Conservative methods include rest, physiotherapy, bracing, and pharmacological treatments such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids",
  "Surgical approaches involve internal fixation with plates and screws, external fixation, joint arthroplasty (total knee replacement, total hip replacement), and minimally invasive procedures like arthroscopy",
  "Post-surgical rehabilitation is crucial for restoring function, improving strength, and preventing complications.",

  "okay going to talk about orthopedic trauma in this PowerPoint though break it up into a few different lecture files so here are objectives firstly to understand the assessment and basic management of fractures to understand why some fractures do not heal so called nonunions and we'll talk briefly about wider fractures not heal and what are some of the ways we can get around that and then to understand the complications and associated injuries that present with fractures especially things like compartment syndrome other neurovascular injuries and how you can now stay out of trouble with those so what is orthopedic trauma well it's the management of fractures and their related injuries and whereas you know fractures can occur in the hands and foot and ankle and many fractures can be certainly ambulatory if patient has a fracture that go to urgent care or a hospital emergency department perhaps or a doctor's office and they're ambulatory they're not necessarily in the hospital but a lot of times when we think about orthopaedic trauma we think about you know sick patients in the hospital with severe injuries and overall this includes the operative and non operative care to help patients return to function after injury all right so I'm just going to outline some of the sort of broad topics that we're going to cover and in this lecture things you should know so extremity and pelvic fractures associated neurovascular injury compartment syndrome open fractures and soft tissue injury musculoskeletal infection pathologic fractures includes osteoporosis a lot of times we don't really refer to osteoporosis or osteoporosis as pathologic fractures but by definition pathologic fractures does include them so we'll kind of group them together a little bit fracture nonunions splinting and casting principles and basic surgical fixation principles just real basic stuff towards the end so let's talk about fractures and certainly anything about orthopaedic trauma this is mostly what we're talking about well I'll go through some real basic anatomy and terminology stuff that we talked about second-year mechanisms evaluation of patients with fractures basic management both surgical and non-surgical certainly in this section of the talk that's going to be a lot of review from the lecture covered in your second year block so definitely get familiar with some of the basic terminology proximal distal cancellous and cortical the diaphysis of the bone you know which has the medullary canal the metathesis which is the trabecular and right you know both at the proximal and distal end and then the epiphysis right which is the articular surface and I guess in common clinical speak you're not going to hear the term epiphysis used a whole lot we can usually talk about the articular surface and the joint surface and in that way be discussing the articular a pith the seal end of the bone so cortical bone is the compact bone and makes up 80% of the skeleton has a high compressive bending and rotational strength it has a slow turnover as opposed to Kent's Ellis bone which is a spongy bone comprises 20% of the skeleton it's less dense and strong and has a high turnover rate so by turnover we mean that for instance if you have a fracture and it breaks in the diaphysis that's going to be in a cortical bone perhaps a little slower to heal it's going to take more energy to break that part of the bone whereas cancellous bone more susceptible to fracture because it's less dense and strong but when it does fracture it's going to heal faster okay and that's kind of some enhanced micrographs of perhaps what a cortical bone would look like you have these tightly packed osteons versus cancellous bone which is more of a loose meshwork of trabecula so again some definitions well what are fractures defined well firstly I always like to say it's the same as being broken and quote-unquote because a lot of people sometimes make a distinction like is it patients in particular is it broken is it fractured oh I thought it was I thought it was broken I'm glad to hear it's only fractured so it's really the same thing okay so a lot of times I think you need to make sure your patient is clear on that because you may say one thing and they think it means something else either better or worse so make it clear that fracture is a break and it's essentially a disruption of the bone cortex right I can occur in any type of bone you know flat bones long bones it can occur in any part of the bone as we talked about the epiphysis metaphysis de-emphasis it can result in pain loss of related function as you would imagine so here's somebody with a femur fracture cannot facilitate motion cannot provide structural support so that's what bone is trying to do when it's completely disrupted then those functions are lost so what about mechanisms well when a fracture occurs there is essentially some type of mechanical failure of the bone under stress now this could be an axial loading or compression type injury it can be a rotation or a torsional type of an injury it could be a bending injury and it could be a missile type injury right either way a fracture can occur with one of these mechanisms here we see that there is a probably a bending type of an injury with a butterfly fragment so what about evaluation well um like anything in medicine certain clinical medicine everything starts with a history and orthopedics is really know you know there's really no exception here you need to get a good clinical history you have to move on to a physical examination and certainly an orthopaedic physical examination is very important it's not one of the disciplines where you sort of take a history and jump right to tests but tests are important especially imaging right you're looking at trying to look at bones the radiographs CT scans MRIs etc and we'll get into that so history frequently there's gonna be some trauma right now in some cases it may be a traumatic but you want to listen from the patient what happened and sometimes if it's a traumatic that can be important the patient has a fracture and there was no trauma you have to start thinking well maybe there was some bone tumor or something the patient was walking it suddenly the bone gives way or just heard a big crack there's always going to be pain okay so if the patient doesn't have pain it sounds intuitive but I mean most like it doesn't have fracture same thing on exam like when you're examining a patient and I'll get to that sometimes the patient will tell you they heard a crack or somebody heard a crack and of course there should be some immediate disability so as opposed to somebody comes in and says well I don't know when it started hurting it's been bothering me for a week you know this something like that could be a stress fracture perhaps and we're not going to get too much into that in this talk but you know the fracture that you normally think of is not going to occur in some sort of vague timeframe there's going to be an immediate disability so in physical exam you're going to certainly start with inspection look for deformities look for swelling look for ecchymosis you want to see if zero open wound perhaps with the with the fracture scene I would make it an open fracture like this one here as I mentioned you want to look for pain right so tenderness localized to the fracture site tenderness localized to the fracture site this is really important because take an ankle injury for instance patient twists their ankle to come into the ER or office or whatever if you have if you can elicit bony tenderness on your exam that is very suspicious you know now again the ankle it's it's you know it could be fractured it could be sprained it has subcutaneous structures you could pretty much put your finger you know pretty much right on skin and immediately underneath is bone on the medial malleolus or the lateral malleolus Frank for instance it's a little bit harder to put your finger exactly on the tailor for instance a lot more soft tissue in the way but when you can confidently put your finger almost on top of bone and have tenderness and the patient did not have any direct trauma to that area so B gets hit with a baseball on the forearm over they all know that I mean that's going to hurt when you press the ulna but the patient twisted their ankle now have pain over the lateral malleolu and not just the ligaments then you have to be concerned so palpation is really important especially you know with these type of injuries there's somatic it's a somatic pain so as opposed to maybe an MI where a patient's just kind of vaguely has pain you know maybe in the chest maybe in the abdomen maybe in the left shoulder I mean orthopedic pain is very very local it can be very localized it's a somatic pain there's instability there's potentially painful range of motion near a joint and an impaired pule potentially I mean you have to look for this at least you're looking for circulation you're looking for you know associated injuries perhaps you want to get a detailed neurologic exam right so you want to look for sensation reflexes motor exam you know with sensation of course you can check both light touch pressure two-point discrimination is something that we also check for particularly with suspected nerve injury in the hand motor exam you want to grade from one to five right so one is no motion five is good emoton and against resistance so if I was checking someone's quadriceps I would grade it from a motor strength of one to five and as I'll get to later these are things that you need to be very specific in your examination and potentially repeat examination and when you come on around you'll see how often we kind of like check this again and again every time we see the patients all right so um it'll probably stop there and then we'll pick up on the imaging and move ahead and the next part of the talk Thanks so in the uh first part of this presentation kind of focused mostly on some uh uh basic uh uh anatomical descriptions right we talked about uh uh fractures and sort of how to uh keep in mind the um parts of the bone uh anatomically right so this way is proximal right and then uh away from the center of the body right that's distal right and then you have your your uh your uh anatomic areas of the bone right so this would be the say this is the diaphysis of the tibia all this area um and then you have the metaphysis which is probably distal metaphysis would be here proximal met is maybe this portion here and then you have the epiphysis right or the uh portion with the articular surface right so the joint surface so uh diaphysis uh metaphysis and epiphysis all right so keep those in mind obviously we're going to use a lot of that terminology uh The Joint surface sometimes we just call The Joint surface rather than the epiphysis or the distal end and we talked about physical examination about how you know you need to look for tenderness uh to palpation at the fractor site for questionable cases you know you're not always going to have a case that looks like this for instance um uh and uh now we're going to come to Imaging right so plain radioraps are often sufficient right you need the uh orthogonal views meaning like an AP and a lateral for uh so that you don't miss uh injuries like for instance if there's a fracture that looks non-displaced on an AP it can be completely displaced on a lateral um because there two there's a two dimensional views right um when we look at diaphysial fractures we typically want to get a joint above and a joint below right so uh reason for that is um you know if you have a diaphysial fracture here uh a diap fracture frequently can present with a dislocation at the Joint right now in the lower leg we don't see it as much in the upper extremity we see it a lot so we often you know tell uh residents to make sure that you check uh like for forearm fracture an elbow and a wrist okay so joint above joint below especially for the you know the diaphysial fractures especially the upper extremities so CT scans sometimes needed right so CT scans are and I'll get into that um looking at certain fractur in a different way preoperative planning articular injuries Etc and then MRI and nuclear Imaging uh can be done for Ault fractures maybe a stress fracture maybe a femoral neck fracture in a patient where you high you suspect it and you really have want to be 100% sure if there's a fracture there but you can't see it on x-ray so what about CT scans well CT scans are um uh for better assessing uh articular fractures right so The Joint surface sometimes uh you know you you can't see certain fracture lines you really want to know if there's a fractur line because if the joint is disrupted or if there's a fracture through the joint that affects a moving part right um so CT scans are helpful for that um they are uh good for preoperative planning purposes okay so certainly if you think about uh something like this pelvis over here uh with this acetabulum fracture looks like perhaps the acetabulum uh fractor through here perhaps through the posterior wall as well not sure if the femoral head is even in the acetabulum uh and with these 3D U Recons you can often take this image and you know spin at 360 uh and up and down and you can kind of look and see Peak back what's back here Peak what's on the you know inner part of the pelvis here and you know for pelvic scapular and spine fractures they're really helpful right because they're not just simple long bones uh they're very very three-dimensional structures and uh CT scanning can be helpful for that and it didn't really show but in this uh uh uh here there is actually a SI joint dislocation okay so uh that's something that may have been missed on a um on a uh plain x-ray so what about treatment well bone heals Itself by regenerating uh new bone tissue rather than um Scar Tissue right so um if you think about when you cut your skin or you tear muscle hears with heals with scar tissue but bone it can't heal with scar tissue right it needs to be uh it needs to provide mechanical support uh so it has to heal with something strong like bone so it actually is a regenerative uh healing process where it creates new bone rather than just a scar tissue uh now we can assist it in optimizing multiple factors like fractural alignment or so-called reduction um articular alignment length rotation uh the local environment so you know when we decide that we have to manage a fracture patient comes to us as the doctor what are you going to do well these are the things that you can do to help them um heal in an optimal uh manner so what are some of these options well they are closed reduction and casting here's a nice example of of a long leg cast for somebody who maybe had a tibia fracture um o r or open reduction internal fixation uh perhaps with a like a plate and screws here's an example of a fracture implant plate that you may see in the operating room uh external fixation something shown here when you have pins coming out of the skin and then bars and clamps holding it in place uh perhaps intramed rotting here an example of a rod that we may put in somebody's tibia for instance uh inside the bone in the intramed canal or arthroplasty just like a joint replacement so those are just you know some of the broad options that uh are there Surgical and non-surgical so casting and bracing are indicated when fractural alignment is acceptable when immediate joint motion is not necessary and uh when surgery is contraindicated okay so it doesn't have to be contraindicated but if it is contraindicated then you're left with having to do a cast or a brace for for many cases open reduction internal fixation is indicated when an atomic reduction of the fracture is necessary so if you need to make something look perfect for whatever reason we won't get into all of that but one thing I would say is joint surfaces for instance need to be uh anatomic so when you have a disruption of the joint surface we usually have to open it put it back together um uh some nonarticular fractures like we see here in this humoris uh sometimes are better off treated with open reduction internal fixation I won't get too much into why some do and some don't but uh certainly like I said articular fractures do um if you have a fracture where early joint motion is preferable so come back to this or even this um if you were to treat a let's say if it was a non-displaced scaphoid non-surgically patient would be in a cast for um potentially 3 months or so whereas if you treat them with fixation the patient can move their wrist sooner and you know for somebody who works somebody uses their hands a lot that may be really beneficial um similarly humorous fracture I mean if a I don't know a surgeon where to break their humorus they may not uh want to be in a splint or a cast for months not able to move the elbow or shoulder and may prefer to be fixed so that they can actually go on and use their elbow and arm and use move the joint points so sometimes surger is indicated for for those reasons what about external fixation well XIX or external fixation is indicated when surgical reduction and uh stabilization is needed but uh both casting and internal fixation are contraindicated sorry the picture cut off those last couple of letters there um but uh this is for severe open fractures uh for or uh infections and these are just some examples uh or perhaps the Bony Anatomy is not amable to internal fixation right so if you have uh uh here you have uh this nice example of a straight uh tibia you could imagine if you wanted to I mean if f this patient was definitively going to be treated with a rod I mean you can get a rod you know commercially avilable a rod that drop down there s it's not perfectly straight but let's just say that that person's uh uh tibia was normally like in in that particular patient they had rickets or something and they have this long sloping bow and then they fracture here well you know they don't make rods to go inside someone's tibia and recreate this you know and you may not want to recreate that you may fix this so that they become straight but um or let's just say the patient doesn't have uh a proper uh Canal right so you know there's actually it's Hollow right so there's a there's like a meary canal where the rod has to fit well some people that Canal is extremely narrowed and um you can't get a rod to go down so uh in those cases um again something like an external fixator is you can put a couple of pens in a bar and just about anything uh and these are two examples here's an example of a um uh sort of a uni planer simple fix Itor uh and here' an in perhaps there's a uh um perhaps there's a fracture uh let's just get rid of this and perhaps there's a uh maybe there was a fracture here or something like that and uh two pins above two pins below uh this is called a ring fixator here so in here you actually have a circular fixation is a ring here ring here sort of like rings and half rings around the foot um different reasons for using this this can actually use thin tensioned wires um it has a lot of other uh potential applications when you do aring Fixit we won't get into too much of that um coming back to this the uh portable traction right so sometimes you have a fracture in the knee or the ankle let's just say as examples uh and the joint surface is compressed and um you just want to get it out to length and actually this is where you're going to see xfix used a lot Trauma Centers uh you put some uh pins down here in the tibia uh you put some pins uh let's see for a knee fracture you put some pins up here in the femur and then you sort of you know you pull traction right you distract this way and this way and um you pull things you know the The Joint surface out to length and it's like a portable traction essentially right it's like pulling on the person's leg except the person can move around with that and in that case it could be something temporary but in some cases external fixation is definitive so um it can be used for both but most of the time you see it used as temporary treatment and what about intrend nailing well these are rods right that go in the inary canal they're indicated when it's okay to have only gross fractural alignment to restore function typically for diaphysial fractures mostly the tibia and femur but some bones to the lesser extent the humorous uh can be rotted as well they even make rods for almost anything with a which has a canal uh forearm you know metacarpal Etc but uh most of the time they're used and they're successful in the femur and tibia and they do require a patent medary Canal without pre-existing deformities uh because these rods cannot be really shaped or anything I mean they're they come into commercially available you know sizes and widths and curves and um you have a patient has a little bit too much uh atypical morphology of their bone the Rod's not going to go in you know plates and screws you can sometimes Bend and twist and get them to fit and like I said an xfix you can put on almost anything but rods really really uh have to kind of they have a they have a tight path to navigate and arthroplasty right so arthroplasy is indicated for articular and periarticular fractures right so fractures of the joint surface and and right near the joint surface when repair is not not possible okay and replacement is the only option to return to function so uh I give an example of a femoral neck fracture that's displaced in the elderly right because the other thing is certain joint Replacements you don't want to do in younger patients the hip being one of them uh another example is a common nuted radial head fracture not a weightbearing uh thing so you will see sometimes see these done in younger patients if it's absolutely necessary and unfixable another example head splitting proximal humorous fracture in the elderly you could potentially treat with an arthroplastic or joint replacement you basically say you know what this is not going to come out well if we try to fix it it's going to have a poor outcome it might not heal it might have osteon necrosis we're just going to throw it in the trash put in a joint replacement and that's going to make this patient functional not need more surgery and because they're older it's not going to wear out in a year or two um as opposed to you know 20 30 year olds we try not to do joint replacement so I'm going to stop there and um we'll pick up with some of the associated injuries and neurovascular exam compartment syndrome in the next set of slides thanks so in the uh last uh talk I kind of went through uh some of the Imaging for fractures and then basic treatment like splinting casting internal fixation external fixation arthroplasty so we're going to move a little bit on now and talk about Associated neurovascular injury now keep in mind fractures don't occur in isolation right some some surgeons even say that a fracture is a soft tissue injury with a broken bone associated with it so think about it that way too that these things don't occur in isolation and that neurovascular injury is not always obvious and I'm going to really emphasize this it really requires careful and repeated examination for you know the astute clinician to make sure they're not missing something and the reason this is important is because what you might be missing could be very disabling you know you know very disabling the patient and potentially very costly to you if it's something you miss and you know there's any legal implications so we'll talk about vascular injury nerve injury and keep in mind nerve injury requires patient cooperation you know for most nerve examination or I should say nerve examination or to detect nerve injury requires patient cooperation and I'll talk about compartment syndrome which just you know don't miss it you know make sure you uh uh are aware of this condition how to diagnose it Etc so vascular injury can certainly occur from penetrating or blunt trauma it requires immediate diagnosis and treatment and of course that's because tissue death can occur within hours of warm ischemia and this involves early involvement by vascular surgery and here you can see an example of the uh popliteal artery coming down to these books to be a horrible open fracture with lots and lots of bone loss and just kind of gets cut off right about there so neurologic injury needs a Cooperative patient right so if a patient is unable to talk unable to communicate maybe they're intubated whatever they can't tell you if they feel anything they won't move anything for you I mean you can maybe check reflexes but sometimes that's hard if a fractured or injured extremity so this can be a problem uh so you need to cooperate a patient you need and you also need to do careful and repeated examination and I really make a huge emphasis obviously on this um because look at this example here right so you have the patient with a um hip dislocation right patient sitting in a car um maybe there's a dashboard injury or something like that and you could see there's uh there's this energy you know going this way femoral head goes out the back and then the uh now there's like sort of stretch injury to the sciatic nerve right so this patient might develop some you know uh sciatic nerve uh neuropraxia perhaps they have some numbness in their foot perhaps they get a complete foot drop um perhaps they're it's only um the perineal Division and it's very very common right a patient can have a foot drop sciatic nerve injury but they can still plantar Flex their toes so you see this all the time where you know nurse will say well the patients wiggling their toes or one of the other docs will say oh patients wiggling the toes are good but really all they're doing is their plants are flexing the toes and then they just come back up to neutral uh when they let go but they actually can't dorsiflex the toes all the way and that's that's important because they have a foot drop and of course if somebody's evolving a compartment syndrome in the lower leg the same thing can happen so a careful examination know what you're looking for repeated examination because things can change over time right person comes in they don't have let's stick with this let's this example they don't have a foot drop and then they develop a foottropoliter well why did they develop that uh and then everybody looks at themselves and says well was the patient moving their toes and everybody's like yeah they're moving the toes I think he felt I think he felt something I don't know well how careful were you with the examination maybe they felt something on the planner aspect of the foot but no one checked the dorsal aspect of the photo the first dorsal web space and um now you don't know is it an interval change or not it's very important to be careful here um three types of neurologic injury right there's neuropraxia there's accident mises and there's neurotomesis right so neuropraxia is a sensory deficit accident mises is uh when you have an additional degree of injury with sensory and motor deficits cases surgery could be needed and then there's neurotmesis which is a disruption or severing the nerve and in these cases you require surgery right so let's talk about compartment syndrome it made a lot of references to this uh and we did talk about a little bit in your second year block but this is when you have increased intercompartmental pressure right either due to fracture or due to severe soft tissue injury this can be due to prolonged pressure or prolonged typo perfusion to the limb and tissue ischemia occurs which can lead to muscle death and of course death is permanent right so um if this happens you potentially will have I wouldn't necessarily say a dead leg but perhaps in dead muscle and you know of course that can be a lawsuit or you know a certainly very unhappy patient you take a minute to take a look at this I want you to just sort of fixate this in your head and you know don't miss this when it presents itself um there is a nice picture here showing a fasciotomy release and a patient who had a compartment syndrome so it's a surgical emergency requires immediate fasciotomies so what are the um uh clinical signs right you have the five P's with sharp pain paresthesia paralysis power pulselessness so the reason I make a big deal about pain is because that's what you want to be looking for you know is the pain out of proportion do they have pain with passive stretch if it's a kid do they just seem really anxious and you're not sure why it just seems a little bit more than you than it ought to be um because the problem is once you start to get the paresthesias it might be a little too late certainly when you start to get into paralysis like a patient with lower leg compartment syndrome now has a foot drop now you're probably in trouble and you're probably already starting to have some irreversible injury to the muscle so um and of course you know once you have pulselessness now you yeah you actually might lose your limb so um five PS but really really focus on pain and if you're snowing a patient with pain medication you're not going to know right so I mean you don't with you don't withhold medications from the patient but you certainly also have to make sure you can keep track of what they're getting and that it's not excessive now keep in mind that a lot of this stuff maybe not pulses but I mean a lot of this stuff especially the pain you cannot measure uh in an abundant or intubated patient or a patient who has some other communication problem so for instance children especially small children patients who have a different language or culture or a psychiatric problem and this stuff comes up I mean I've certainly had patients who um or just can they were particularly stoic and they didn't you know in their culture and they didn't really speak very good English and you know they seemed a little anxious perhaps but uh not nearly as much as some other patients um and we happen to somehow pick up on the fact they were having called compartment syndrome where we release them and all of a sudden they're ecstatic and now you realize that that was something maybe you could have picked up on earlier ahead of time and it was just a sort of a communication thing and it's so subjective when you go with the when you go with pain and the five PS that it makes compartment syndrome easy to miss so compartment pressure measurements are the other more objective finding the problem is it's not as easy as just slopping on a blood pressure cuff for instance right it's an invasive test not a lot of people are comfortable doing it is uh something also that you don't just sort of get a number and decide okay now you have compartment syndrome people who do follow absolute numbers will use a number of greater than 30 but more people have found that a Delta p is a more reliable way to go about it so what that is is if your diastolic pressure minus the compartment pressure is less than 30",
  "then you have a problem meaning like if your diet stock pressure is 90 and your compartment pressure is 35 then you're probably fine okay but if that patient's dies they'll look pressure drops to 60 and now your compartment pressure is 35 well I am a problem right and of course the problem is diastolic pressure doesn't it's not a static thing either so if the patient's perfusion pressure overall drops well now that compartment pressure differential the Delta P there becomes uh narrower and I have a problem similar to how how you know that a lot of neurosurgeons think about the cerebral perfusion pressures or most commonly in the leg and forearm but they can also occur in the thigh foot arm hand and buttock they can occur in patients who are found down what do I mean by that well I mean you've probably seen some of these patients in the hospital they uh drug or alcohol induced stupor and they basically are down on the ground for hours to the point that they get pressure necrosis like or not pressure crosses but they can get prolonged pressure on one of the compartments that can lead to a compartment syndrome and in those patients they can actually get Rhabdomyolysis and um anyhow um so like I said about 10 times now compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency when a diagnosis is made a misdiagnosis can lead to permanent muscle death contractors and um lawsuits unfortunately all right so um I think I'll stop there for uh for this section and then we'll pick up with open fractures in the next one thanks all right so um going to pick up with open fractures in the last section um we talked about um Associated injuries looking for um compartment syndrome careful neurologic and neurovascular examinations making sure you don't miss patients who drop their pulses um making sure uh you don't uh misdiagnose somebody just wiggling their fingers or wiggling their toes for an evolving neurologic problem that U you're not thoroughly diagnosing because you're only looking for minimal movements um and uh now we're going to move on to open fracture so open fracture essentially are fractures that communicate with uh you know the environments outside the body through a skin opening okay now um obviously this example here is an open fracture uh but uh you know this is the extreme example sometimes it's not so clear right you just have a patient with a fracture and then there's some abrasions on the leg and one of them actually is a little poke hole just seems to be bleeding a little bit too much well actually that could be an open fracture a type one open fracture a poke hole but uh those things can be missed I mean this this this mess here that's that's obviously not going to be missed um and the problem with open fractures are they are at risk for bone and soft tissue infection right so so um important that um you know you treat these properly to avoid these problems they're at higher risk of associated neurovascular injury certainly you know something like that as you imagine would be um and the key to management is early prompt antibiotics and surgical  management to prevent infections so um you make the diagnosis again with a wound near the fracture site with persistent bleeding um maybe that sounds a little bit obvious but uh this is where it can be it can be uh missed and I say persistent bleeding because you think well any wound kind of persistently bleeds well not really I mean if you have a small soft tissue wound and a poke hole in the skin let's just say um let's just say this thing here is a uh poke hole in the skin uh it's going to bleed a little bit eventually it's going to stop right but if if there was a fracture here and there was a poke hole there well you may actually just see persistent bleeding because the bleeding is coming from the bone itself and the fracture sites will bleed and that's usually not going to just Tamp aaot itself off right away so it's a small point but it's really important and this is one of the things we look for to try to distinguish is something just a small wound or is it potentially communicate with the fracture site well the other thing you look for is air in the joint or in subcutaneous tissues on maybe an x-ray or CT scan right so if you're not sure you know it's thick soft tissue envelope there's a small hole you're not really sure if you see air in the joint and it's a distal femur fracture going into the joint well then you have to think geez how did that air get down in there must have been some communication that hole must have communicated down right so the wound could be a poke hole or an open massive wound like in the last slide and this is this here is something in between this is actually a uh this is the back of the heel this the toes out this way the uh knee is way up in this direction this is the back of the heel this is actually an open um calanus um evulsion fracture right where uh fracture evoled off of the calcinus and tented and actually went through the skin here are some terms you probably should be familiar with um I think it is appropriate at the medical student level you sort of be you know a little bit aware of some classifications and if there's anyone in trauma you should be aware of it's probably this one uh you know Castillo Anderson classification talks about you know the type one two and three open fractures and these are sort of some typical examples so the type one is essentially when you have a small wound poke hole perhaps uh less than a centimeter whereas a type two is usually a little bit more trauma youan you can see here how this is now you know a little bit more complex fracture I mean some people would even say that if you have a true segmental fracture maybe it's a type three but we'll just say know maybe a little bit more of uh severe fracture but the the but the wound right so the wound is one to 10 cm so these are still not massive nasty open fractures but um they're not just poke holes right so it's a real wound there typically you know 3 4 centimeters something like that especially for a tibia um and then you have the type 3es right so the type threes are big wounds right like that last patient I mean maybe not that massive but you know 10 cm you know and and more so um if all if if that's all you have then you have a type 3A right uh or if you just have you know bad fracture segmental with some soft tissue stripping I mean that you may call that a type 3A whereas type 3B is a case that requires a flap right so some type of soft tissue coverage procedure you know you need to get plastic surgery involved perhaps so these are these are cases that are little you know now we're jumping up into you know the type of cases that are much more prone for infection you know that's really what what we're worried about and it's really what you see you know go up the ladder or increase in incidence as you go up the ladder right so you know the type ones here um you know pretty low incidence like you know single digits uh of infection and um you know as we kind of uh get down to the type 3bs and type 3 C's uh you have much higher incidences of infection and type 3C is when you have a vascular injury requiring repair so just because you have maybe the paranal artery injured in in a tibia fracture doesn't mean uh you know and they say it doesn't need repair then it's not a type 3C so type 3C really means like the limb is completely at risk of limb loss um so that just also increases the you know the esema the potential for infection Etc so open fractures you know management you need to give immediate antibiotics and this is you know easier said than done if you don't pick up on the fact that the patient has an open fracture you know like a type one or poke hole you're probably not going to get antibiotics right away now that said the type one opens fortunately are the ones that don't get infected as as easily anyway um so maybe that helps but um certainly this is not a surgical maneuver it doesn't require any specialty uh uh care I mean this is just recognizing and giving antibiotics um so we do expect that that's something that should happen promptly um it's important to reduce the fracture provisionally irrigate the wound splint uh and then do operative debent go to the O uh debed the open fracture stabilize it and then possibly that those patients sometimes need additional debent antibiotic beads plastic surgery flaps Etc so what about muscular skeletal infection well this certainly is tied in a little bit to the um to the last uh slide you know on on open fractures because open fractures are more prone to infection um you know uh these are bad okay um and uh it's a complication that's associated with trauma It's associated with operative management of fractures um certainly a case like this this uh you can see here um there's a chronically exposed steel plate here you can see that the the bone here is uh you know very yellow and sclerotic looking uh you've got these sort of uh cables that actually go completely around the bone and the plate and uh they are causing some stripping perhaps there um this does not look healthy it's probably Dead uh and um now you have probably bacteria on this of course now it's an open mo the whole thing is colonized so this is a disaster okay and I cannot overemphasize that um and just stepping back for a second you know infections also include cellulitis now fortunately those can be typically treated with antibiotics but a deep infection you know down to Bone uh you know or at least a deep soft tissue infection require antibiotics and surgical management so an abscess something like this they're operative uh problems and these are severely disabling okay again cannot emphasize that enough getting a uh infected non-union or osteomyelitis of the bone um it is one of the most uh you know devastating uh conditions a patient can really uh have to go through because you're talking about months years of treatment uh people lose their jobs lose their spouses um and um often kind of go down a sort of downward spiral when these things happen if they don't have an excellent support network so we are very paranoid about trying to prevent it from happening so if it develops after a fracture is healed um then um to breed mons removal of implants antibiotics uh sometimes can be fine you know so the fracture is healed you don't need an implant anymore um get it out of there clean it out hopefully that gets rid of the infection uh and if not you can go further but if it develops before a fractures it heal is healed now you have a dilemma because um fractur is not healed you kind of need the implant to keep the fracture in place you take it off maybe it falls apart uh I'm not going to get too much into when you keep stuff when you remove it like it's it's a very complicated subject but um certainly a situation like this can lead to or even just present with basically what's called an infected non-union bone hasn't healed and it's got P an infection in it incredibly difficult problem to manage and I'll just leave it at that chronic osteomyelitis is when you have um essentially now you have dead bone you have persistent draining sinus perhaps and chronic bone infection essentially is a surgical problem right antibiotics alone are only going to suppress the drainage uh any ID doctor will tell you that uh you know the the cure for this is really surgical debent that said I mean with aggressive treatment cutting it out completely adant antibiotic therapy you can cure people of chronic osteitis kind of like a cancer right so here's an example of a um patient who has here's an AP here's a lateral on the lateral you can see there's this fracture line here uh you can see there's maybe some sclerotic bone uh persistent non-union uh we'll just tell you this patient was also infected uh so this patient has a uh bone transport uh they actually you know will cut out a section of bone they have this tensioned this is a circular external fixator remember I said a couple of lectures ago that X fixes with the rings are very versal can be used for many different uh um treatments well here's one you cut out the bone you do something called distraction osteogenesis once you've gotten rid of the infection you now transport grow new bone so um most of this bone is new bone you can see it looks different than everything else and they basically grew that bone in the place of where all that infected bone was it's pretty amazing um but uh you know it's a lot of treatment but if you really want to get rid of an infection that's one way to do it all right so um we'll stop there and we'll pick up with uh pathologic fractures osteoporosis hip fractures and stuff in the next talk thanks so in the uh last talk I went through um open fractures um osteomyelitis deep bone infection uh we talked about how um you know with open fractures the whole goal is to try and avoid infection and especially avoid um chronic infection like osteomyelitis it's a very devastating problem an infected non-union is even more devastating um and um that said in some patients uh it can be cured uh with aggressive reection um but it's a very it takes a very certain uh you know type of patient to be able to go through that um and uh certain local biology and of course surgeon who knows how to how to handle it to to get a patient through a bad case of chronic osteomyelitis so we're going to move on now and talk a little bit about patholog IC fractures and as I said in the very first uh lecture at the beginning that we'll also kind of lump in osteoporosis here and then I'll also tie in Hip fractures being sort of the one of the prototypical osteoporotic fractures that I think you know as clinici you should be aware of and know a little bit about so um many pathologic fractures will give a history of minimal or no trauma so especially a tumor like this somebody's got a tumor here may just say like suddenly they got up out of a chair and their leg gave away and they come in and they have this fracture and I would tell you that it's not always this obvious where there's this big sort of mothy and litic type lesion in this little crack here they'll probably come in just with a fracture because once it's broken it's a little bit harder to to see that it broke through a lesion uh especially if it's not a big lesion like this uh but another but it's important this is where history is really really important you get this from the history they come in with a femur fracture you don't take a careful history you may not recognize um that maybe there was a tumor there that said they may also have uh prodromal pain meaning that you know you get more history and they say well yeah you know it's been hurting me for about a week um or a month or something and the Pain's been getting worse alway hurts when I walk on it so um it's important to pick up on that history so it's due to weakening of the bone by a tumor or metabolic disease um and uh you know osteoporosis is um certainly a uh um more in the metabolic disease category those typically do involve some trauma so whereas somebody with big litic Legion here probably has no trauma uh an osoo fracture will occur with some trauma but it's usually not like they would not like a severe trauma so whereas you know uh a young healthy patient would have to be in a car crash to break their hip and Elder person can fall out of their chair and break their hip right so it's sort of a spectrum of of trauma um or how much trauma it takes to break your bone okay um a a tumor um could be uh known metastatic disease so somebody with known metastatic breast cancer let's just say or unknown metastatic disease somebody presents with pathologic fracture you you figure it seems to be pathologic but they don't have known medicine itic disease but this is the first presentation of it that happens um or it could be a bone tumor meaning a primary bone tumor like osteosarcoma or something like that or Myoma certainly one of the more common ones so um you know tumors are either primary or secondary right so primary bone tumor is much less common although Myoma in you know certain age group is uh um somewhat common but by far you know as far as tumors are concerned most of what we see are metastatic disease and most metastatic diseases in older patients now um metabolic ideology als um uh you will also see this mostly osteoporosis um although other disease like padet and Hyper parathyroidism are not completely uncommon um suspect a primary tumor in younger patients with aggressive appearing lesions so something like this you know you could say um you know it's kind of got a poorly uh defined zone of transition maybe this is not the absolute best example but um you know there's clearly a litic legion here I'm not sure it's absolutely here but uh you know looks like there's a fracture over here I think the legion comes here but I'm not sure maybe it extends further um I mean I would say this this certainly looks a little bit aggressive U perhaps there's some per osial reaction that here maybe not a great example but there's a fracture through here um so this is example of an pathologic fracture uh in a um aggressive appearing lesion um possibly bone primary bone tumor here's an example of pad's disease very classic radiographic appearances here so here you can see some of the um appearances of the sort of thickened cores coarse thickened tabula right so you can kind of uh you can see some of that uh over here and over here or very some people say very purposeful tabula where they kind of stand out a little bit uh you have this Boe okay and the Boe here and uh the metabolic disease you know with padet probably is what predisposed to this fracture occurring you know under tension over here because when you have this uh bow like this there's going to be tension at this area you can see a crack starts here and then propagates over here so um not not a good uh not a good situation tough to deal with because these fractures have delayed healing uh also keep in mind that a small percentage of patients with pageants can have malignant transformation to a pagetoid osteosarcoma um a rare thing but something that gets tested on um what about uh metastatic disease well it's the uh most common uh cause of uh of uh what we see um causing pathologic fractures other than osteoporosis um so again you're relatively older patients 50 60 70 80 um they're most likely going to have uh metastatic disease if you uh see a bone lesion pathologic fracture um location wise the femur and the humor are the most common appendicular sites so the femoral neck trinic region you can see there's actually multiple lesions here right there's one here uh there's a kind of a lesion maybe over here a little bit less defined uh there's one here if you look very carefully you can see the cores are a little bit scalloped out um so uh uh the humor like I said is another common location for metastatic disease of course the spine and pelvis are what we're talking mostly here about long bones so let's talk about osteoporosis well osteoporosis is when you have a decrease in bone density with normal bone mineralization okay so it's just overall thin bones it's different than osteomalacia like vitamin D deficiency would you know just decreased bone matrix mineralization with or without a change in bone density and there's multiple risk factors which I list here aprotic fractures include hip fractures and other fragility fractures they're increasing in incidence they're more diff it's more difficult to achieve stable fixation with surgical repair because you know the bone is thinner right so the screws don't hold as well I mean there's been a whole sort of wave in technology with locking plates and sort of advanced fixation devices to uh get better repairs in osteoporotic patients uh keep in mind that if an LLY patient has a low energy hip fracture they most likely have osteoporosis and should be treated medically uh that is if they didn't know they had osteoporosis if they fall out of their chair and have hip fracture and they look osteopenic on x-ray well they probably have osteoporosis by definition and um you know they should be referred to their medical doctor for treatment once they leave the hospital now prevention with proper screening can prevent fragility fractures and I won't get into that too much here but obviously dexa scanning appropriate screening by uh you know in in Primary Care can help to prevent hip fractures and fragility fractures from occurring in the first place but that said if you diagnose them or importantly if you pick up a patient who has an osteoporotic wrist fracture for instance great opportunity to um get them uh properly screened and treated for osteoporosis at that point before they get a hip fracture okay let's talk about hip fractures um the three you need to know about the femoral neck inner tro andic and sub trinic so these are really anatomic and I'll I'll Focus really more on the top two sub trinic is essentially uh almost like a proximal femur you know femoral shaft fracture essentially uh they can uh you know bleed a lot they typically are fixed with intramed devices but um usually we talk about hip fractures it's most of the time one of the top two um but you'll certainly see sub trokes as well so um a femal neck fracture is an intracapsular fracture um and what I mean by that it's URS with inside the hip joint capsule so it's kind of bathed in joint fluid uh when you get a fracture The Joint fills up and distends with blood um because it's bathed in joint fluid the healing is a little bit slower it's more difficult to achieve um with femoral neck fractures you can disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head and this can lead to osteonecrosis or AVN um and and uh you know that's a very disabling condition when you get AVN um and again AVN is uh you know oston necrosis is the preferred term AVN is a vascular necrosis and uh that is a term that was used uh you know more in the past but you should be familiar with it as well that's a term you may have some clinicians still use uh so here if you look at some of the you know fractures here's a fracture that's relatively non-displaced here's a fracture that's probably displaced although I think they're considering this impacted the fracture line is about here and you can see up here there's a step off right where that fracture you know head is supposed to go uh and then these are examples of displaced FAL neck fractures where the head is completely off right I mean here you can see the fractur the femal neck is right there and then the head is down here this is probably where the other end goes okay so so um how do you treat them well um femal fractures can be treated with um ORF for the impacted and non-displaced uh varieties um here's examples of those uh but displaced fractures are also treated with ORF in young patients and that's an urgent surgery so somebody comes in with a femal neck fracture they're 40 28 whatever consider that young if it's a SP femal neck fracture that's not like some just admit you know go round on the next morning and you know just add it on for the end of the day or whatever I mean that's a relatively urgent surgery that's either you know going at the end of the day uh when it comes in or right away or middle of the night or you know perhaps the next morning at the latest but this is not just some you know case that's going to sit around 24 48 hours and you're just going to sort of do within a day or two but you have to have more sense of urgency in the young patient with a displaced firal neck why well because again the blood supply is disrupted in these it's felt that the the more quickly you um reduce them and restore alignment you can perhaps improve the blood supply hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option in the displaced fractures in the elderly uh especially low demand patients uh here's an example of that whereas higher demand patients we've been found that uh when you do a a Hemi arthr plasting you put a a large large head on the femur it can wear through so you do a hypoplastic here you can see here's actually this part is the femoral head and then this is a metal shell that goes in the acetabulum you'll see this when you do your total joints um and um you have a bearing surface in between and what about in trinic well in trinic fractur are extracapsular fractur there's more blood loss these are the more common types they're treated with o or nail type devices and not with a joint replacement okay so this is actually not a fracture here here um I guess you know we could just show I mean in troken teric here really is talking about you know fractur that occur you know somewhere in this area okay and it's seems like such a small little area but it's just get a lot of fractures there I mean here's a great example down here you can see the ler Truckin is off the fracture is probably somewhere up here and then there's little overexposure here but you can see this is this is not a femal neck fracture right a FAL neck fractur occurs somewhere around here okay so this occurs down here it's extracapsular it's going to be treated with ORF or a nail right here's a couple of examples um here you can see more of this is more of a two-part fracture and treated with this sliding hip screw device and here's a nail this is more of a four-part fracture you have a greater choke cancer lesser Cho cancer fixed with a nail so so I think I'll end there and we'll uh pick up on the fracture non-unions and uh getting close to the end here in the uh next one uh thanks all right so uh in the last uh uh lecture i talked about pathologic fractures both metastatic disease primary bone tumors uh very little bit and we kind of talked a lot about hip fractures right especially ephemeral mac inner trochanteric fractures i think you all should be very familiar with them um of course prevention is key but you can't prevent all of them and with our growing uh older segment of the population we're going to see more and more of these and they're you know patients with hip fractures it's a tough go i mean you have an older patient that medical problems now they have this disabling problem even though we go in and fix them it's very hard to get back functioning um with the hip fracture and the elderly so it's a tough problem so what about refractors don't even heal right it's worth talking about this a little bit well a fractured non-union occurs when a fracture doesn't heal so remember what's needed for fracture healing right it's cells extracellular matrix blood supply molecules growth factors and mechanical stability and these are slides actually from the second year block lecture so you probably don't remember that but i'm refreshing your memory so those are the things needed for fracture healing and of course here you can see there's a fracture that didn't heal right this i'll show this slide again in a couple of slides so there's a history of pain of course they're going to tell you that they're just haven't gotten better they still hurt they still have pain uh on examination they're going to have tenderness directly over the fractured non-union site um and on x-rays is going to be a persistent fracture line scene so the thing is like if patients are just they're still having pain and you're not sure why i mean you can't just say everybody's got a non-union um maybe the fractures you know and if it's progressively healing it just needs time or um if it looks healed and they're having pain it's probably healed or if they're not healed yet and the pain is coming from somewhere els um maybe it's not you know the the the fracture site that's hurting and it's something else or there's an infection so usually they should be they should still be painful at the area of the fracture i think if you're concerned that it's a non-union so there's kind of two ways i think you know you can think about this one is atrophic non-union which is lack of biologic requirements no bone being made needs bone grafting so here you can see an example where there's no being made i'm sorry no bone being made in this little gap here this maybe was an open fracture this sort of stripped and put all these cables in here and that little area just didn't heal as opposed to the hypertrophic non-union right so here there's lack of mechanical stability um lots of bone i mean maybe not a ton of bone here but you can see there's bone being made a bone being made here lots of bone being made here um but the fracture doesn't heal right there's just too much motion so even so it's interestingly the fracture line right so if you were to say that this is you know the normal bone maybe was there i don't know maybe that's a little bit too maybe that's a little maybe it was more like here right all right this is clearly callous bone out here where's the fracture line the fracture should have ended here but the fracture actually extends into the callus right so when you see that that's probably because there's too much motion so it's making bone making bone making bone but it just doesn't bridge because uh you know it doesn't bridge across doesn't bridge this across because there's just too much motion you know going this way and maybe this way or whatever it just can't heal maybe it's going this way in this way but it just can't bridge across right so it needs better stability better stronger fixation perhaps so one reason for a non-union you know the atrophic type is lack of extracellular matrix right so a large defect i mean this is a massive example look at this but a large defect won't heal uh because just no matrix to for new bone to form on top of here you can put you can do bone grafting give it a scaffold for bone to grow onto maybe there's a lack of growth factors hard to diagnose this uh here you can see maybe there's a little bit of bone but you can see the plates coming loose perhaps there's like this loosen c here some bone formation but quite a gap and again i don't think you can say this due to lack of growth factors because it's hard to diagnose those but lack of growth factors is a reason for some fractures not to heal and it can be administered to fracture non-unions in the form of treatment or if you put bone graft you're not only putting a scaffold but you're putting bone morphogenetic proteins you're putting growth factors that can help stimulate bone formation what about poor vascular supply well atrophic non-unions can occur in smokers diabetics patients who've had vascular injury and in these cases certainly vascularized bone and soft tissue transplants or so-called flaps can help and you know when you have a case like this where the intra medullary supply has been cut off i mean you can see the cortex come down here if the cortex come down here almost looks at the cortex here right so the the medullary canal in here is you know shut off and if you can break through this and re-establish the medullary supply that could also help that's one of the things we may do during surgery and going back to example i showed before different case uh same type of concept as the hypertrophic non-union right lack of mechanical stability so here's you know look at this tons of bone sorry tons of bone being formed out here and out here you know the normal outline of the bone was probably there uh lots of callus out here but you can see there's just this fracture line that just goes all the way through and it's still there it needs to be stabilized right the biology is there but bone can't bridge across the fracture site due to the motion so it needs stabilization it doesn't need bone graft you just go in and fix this and it's going to heal so we'll finish off on just a few real few slides on just casting splinting principles this is stuff you kind of have to see you know a little bit more to get an appreciation get your hands on it and some basic internal fixation principles which also you kind of have to see in the or real basic stuff paddle bony prominences you know whenever you put a caster splint on someone allow for swelling you know and remember if you put a cast on you can't really allow for swelling if you tell them to elevate the leg you know watch for skin changes but um you know all you can see is the tip of the toes the tip of the fingers really when you when you're casting people you need adequate analgesia if you're going to do a closed reduction maybe even muscle relaxation if you're going to try to set a fracture or dislocation back in place you know if you're going to do a nice three point i'm sorry nice close reduction you need a three-point mold right so you kind of see there's this um you know force here and then there's the force here and force here so it's like three points to sort of um allow this thing to stabilize and if you remove one of the forces like in this example the reduction is lost so like when you put up when you put this patient in the cast you wrap a cast you know around here you're going to have to sort of push a hand here push a hand here and push something else here sometimes it's your knee for instance you know some people use the side of their head believe it or not but whatever you need 3.6 to sort of get that cast molded properly or splint so casting is it's very technique dependent some people do it well and some people just don't and if you're not going to get good results if you don't um you know there's lots of things that you have to be careful with here here you know this cast ends right near the perineal neck you have to make sure you know you pad this area really really well right because you have the common perineal nerve coming right around there and you don't want to get a get a foot drop you want to sort of keep the foot in like 90 degrees right this is you know a little bit of perspective in the drawing here but you want sort of 90 degrees you know you don't want the foot in too much aquinas you want to have the toes free here um and you want a nice molded cast this can be done with plaster or fiberglass now certainly operative treatment you think about having more complications but you can get complications in the cast right loss of reduction pressure necrosis you know if you inadequately pat it over a bony prominence this can happen really fast you take the cast off a month later and there's like this big huge hole in the skin you know you're looking at bone now or something i mean that's you just don't want that um compartment syndrome right you know it doesn't allow swelling patient who doesn't know what's going on can't communicate whatever uh haven't you know they can't tell you they're having pain and now they have a compartment syndrome nobody knew it now muscle's dead right thermal necrosis right to keep in mind casts when they are turning hard they get hot so again if you're not padded well you can get a problem and also cast removal people often don't get cut with the cast saws but you you get burned right so those things those blades get really hot and if a patient's feeling something you got to stop you know and listen to them and uh if you're not careful you get a burn and those berms they're permanent scars so you do that to a little kid they're always going to have that scar last couple of words on basic internal fixation principles real few words here just a couple of minor things bones heal well with compression techniques you know they certainly can heal uh with other techniques also here's just an example of a compression technique where you can see there's this plate and screws on the bone and then something called the lag screw where you do inter-fragmentary compression across the fracture site using certain special techniques but you can also heal with relative stability like we show you examples of that right intra medullary nailing for instance and uh here you can see some errors right so hopefully once you start seeing some surgeries and maybe some of the slides during this talk have showed you that you know stability is important compression in certain cases like this might have been important here the plate is too thin there are insufficient cortices engaged with this little thin skinny plate the fracture wasn't properly reduced so they left a gap eventually this became a non-union here you can see the plate is broken i don't know if you can see that right it takes a little bit of an angle there's this sort of right here right see that there's broken and broken plate eventually it becomes a non-union right babylon healed see that there's the fibula there there's fibula healed nicely left that one alone and healed right operator on the tibia didn't heal so um obviously not something not done well so just to recap these were our objectives right to understand the assessment and basic management of fractures to understand why some fractures do not heal and to understand the complications and associated injuries that present with fractures and hope i hope these series of lectures and slides help you understand all that thank you very much this lectures on fracture healing and repair I'm Saki Berman one of the orthopedic surgeons at Temple University Hospital director of orthopaedic trauma and these are my conflicts of interests over the last 12 months you can certainly pause this if you like if you have any questions you can contact me at the email below these are elective lecture objectives so number one to understand basic bone anatomy and biology to understand how bone develops and heals after fractures to understand why some fractures do not heal and to understand the complications and associated injuries that present with fractures so just an overview first we'll go through some basic definitions basic anatomy and biology talk about fracture repair and then we'll conclude this first portion of the lecture so two basic definitions hopefully this is a little bit review in the next few slides we'll talk about long bones we'll talk about flat bones some examples of long bones are shown here the radius and ulna the humerus femur tibia metatarsals metacarpals and flat bones include the clavicle and ribs and how these bones form embryologically for instances and as we grow differs as we'll get to other basic terminology proximal is towards the center of the body and distal is further away so in the femur the distal end of the femur is down here the proximal end is at the hip joint you have cancellous bone versus cortical bones or cortical bone is sort of that thick bone that you have mostly for instance in the diaphysis of this femur although you have a thin cortex everywhere else and cancellous bone is predominates for instance in the metathesis and in the epiphysis for instance okay the diathesis also has a medullary canal okay look bone where yet bone marrow the metaphysis is this sort of trabecular end this would be the metaphysis of the the femur approximately and then this would be the distal femur here where apparently I guess there's going to be a fracture and then the epiphysis is sort of that articular end okay a couple words about bone structure okay so we talked about cortical and cancellous bone so cortical bone is a compact bone so for instance in the femoral diaphysis you know and then have lots of dense cortical bone it's makes up about 80% of the skeleton has high compressive bending and rotational strength and is relatively slow turnover a bone as opposed to cancellous bone which is more of a spongy bone that's 20% of the skeleton it's less dense and strong but it has a higher turnover rate so for instance like a fracture would heal faster here then it would in the cortical bone few words about cellular biology I won't get into too much detail but a few cells that you should be aware of or the osteoblast okay so as you can see shown here the osteoblasts forming bone along this periphery the osteocytes which sort of maintain the bone and they reside in so called how ships lacunae and then osteoclasts which resorb bones you can see some here these are multi nucleated type cells sort of macrophage type lineage and they secrete like carbonic anhydrase enzyme and that sort of removes bone so you sort have this balance between the osteoblasts and osteoclasts to for instance remodel bone as needed tissue surrounding the bone include most importantly the periosteum okay this is a connect tissue membrane that covers the bone it's highly vascular and cellular it contributes to increasing cortical diameter and kids and kids are very thick periosteum typically it's what allows you to get for instance the so called green stick fracture where your break on only one end and the other end the periosteum is so thick and the bone is sort of a little bit less brittle and bends very easily that you don't really see in adults it develops callus during fracture healing so this is that again it's highly vascular cellular it's a good source for the fracture to heal other tissues include bone marrow so you have red marrow versus yellow marrow so red marrow has more hematopoietic cells as opposed to yellow the yellow marrow which is mostly fatty okay two types of bone formation that you need to know about especially the first one here endochondral ossification all right this is where bone formation replaces a cartilage model meaning you form cartilage and then it calcifies to form bone osteoprogenitor cells arrive via vascular bugs and a long bone for instance the femur would grow this way and importantly this is also the mechanism by which fracture repair takes place so fracture repair sort of mimics this endochondral ossification model intramembranous ossification on the other hand bone formation is in the flat bone so we talked about the clavicl avigal ribs pelvis so here you actually get bone formation without a cartilage model and the bone cells kind of go right into osteoblasts so I said we were going to focus a little more on endochondral bone formation so here's just a very quick overview of how a long bone for instance like let's just say the humerus or something would form so then this is embryo embryo and embryological so you can see how it's six weeks you have this cartilage model then you develop some vascular ization you get some resorption in the and the canal and you start to form this medullary canal and then you get a secondary ossification center here would you know now you have blood supply coming in here as well but it's sort of separated by this growth plate you can see here what forms is physis or the so called growth plate and that growth plate is where new bone forms until maturity so here's that growth plate so the physis is that growth plate and again this is a cartilage model that then forms bone okay so you have a and this is you know sort of going going down this way okay from immature to mature or I should say cartilage you have a resting or reserved zone where source cells ourselves store up light lipids glycogen proteoglycans then a proliferative zone okay right over here where you have longitudinal growth and sort of this columnar stacking of chondrocytes then you have a hypertrophic zone over here where the chondrocytes increase in size and then you have the zone of ossification which is over here and then here is your you know mature trabecular bone okay so that is the growth plate or the physis so endochondral bone formation grows in this manner and this is what makes long bones grow so for instance at the here you can see here's a here's a growth plate here that kind of obliterated it but you can kind of see it here on the other side okay that sort of line that looks like maybe there's a fracture here's another one here these are okay these are growth plates it looks like sort of this almost like a fracture without all the sharp edges and that's in a child that would be the growt plate now the clinical correlation is if you have some type of abnormality at the growth plate you can't grow long bones all right so for instance a conjurer pleasure or somebody who's an ich Kandra plastic dwarf and I think these are patients who have for instance they have normal sized flat bones such as in the skull but they have very short limbs and they have they have actually there's a defect in the proliferative zone and then there's other forms of pathology here such as mucopolysaccharides is where there's a defect hypertrophic zone and rickets and osteomalacia you have a problem in the ossification zone so these are all forms of bone disease that can occur due to abnormal bone growth so a couple definitions of a fractures since we talking about fracture healing so firstly it means the same thing is broken sometimes a lot of patients often say well is it broken or is it fractured I mean for us means the same thing defined by disruption of the bone cortex as shown here it can occur in any type of bone it can occur in any part of bone and essentially results in pain loss of related function so you can't facilitate motion the bone can't provide structural support I mean this is why you have your skeleton when it's fractured it's no longer doing either of those now these occur by you know mechanisms such as mechanical failure of bone under stress like axial loading okay and that's a compressive force rotation torsion bending missile injury and we're not going to go through too much detail but if you rotate with us you may sort of you see and here's some discussion about you know how different fracture patterns occur so for instance you would imagine a rotational injury can cause a spiraling fracture a bending injury can cause a fracture like this where you can imagine there's been some bending force applied and you know that can cause a fracture to occur this way you could have a missile injury unfortunately at temple hospital we see a lot of gunshot injuries so to wrap up this portion of the lecture going to talk about cellular and molecular regulation of fracture repair we'll go through the stages of fracture repair the concept of how skeletal repair recapitulates the skeletal development with endochondral bone formation and then we'll talk about the components required for skeletal repair including cells extracellular matrix blood supply molecules and growth factors and for bone repair you really have to have a host of things to take place I mean there are some biologic factors that can affect the success or failure of bone repair as in addition to mechanical factors so things like advancing age low functional capacity poor nutrition inadequate profusion poor soft tissue envelope wound contamination tumor infection smoking these things all adversely affect the success of bone healing mechanical factor that can adversely affect bone healing would be lack of bone contact so if you just have a huge gap or you know complete lack of stability could also prevent a bone from healing or fracture from healing I should say so the stages of fracture repair these are classic stages some people break them into four stages with this being one two three and four but other what's the same thing it's just whether or not this is divided up so you have inflammation first you got a hematoma formation and I'll show these in the next few slides then you have repair or soft and then hard callus and then you have a remodeling phase which can take a long time and when you're younger that can this whole process can be much quicker when you're a three-year-old versus if you're a seventy year old so the inflammatory phase you get bleeding you essentially get fracture hematoma is where you see bruising if it's a subcutaneous fracture and literally there's a big hematoma that sits there like blood that just fills this space and that delivers hematopoietic cells including osteogenic cells and eventually this hematoma can organize into a so called granulation tissue right so in the reparative phase you first get the soft bridging callus and here you start to get this endochondral ossification right so you get a cartilage model that forms hematoma organizes and then that eventually turns into a hard so called woven callus and that's bone forming through endochondral ossification initially it's unorganized but this will then become organized in the remodeling phase or you now have mature bone there are stresses that will cause the bone to remodel accordingly so where you're under more compressive stress for instance there's going to be more bone being formed and essentially that's so called the woven bone is replaced with you know your lamellar bone kind of like we saw in one of those slides where I showed that you know the cortical bone for instance and the sort of nice architectural structure here's some you know just the stages of fracture healing shown under micrograph so these are animal fractures and you can see the inflammation or inflammatory phase initially where you know you have a little bit of bleeding and then you have the soft callous phase where you have a lot of cartilage being formed and collagen type 2 and then you have a hard callus and now you're starting to see osteocalcin position and bone formation and then you know the remodeling phase shown on the bottom so as a reminder remember there's two paths to forming bone okay intramembranous ossification which we didn't really talk about because it really doesn't contribute to fracture healing and then endochondral ossification where you have you know sort of in the growing child the growth plate physis and that's very similar to how when you get a fracture you get thi cartilage model followed by followed by formation of bone through the stages of fracture healing now those components again were cells from bone marrow periosteum other sources extracellular matrix to provide a scaffold for cells blood supply to supply oxygen and other systemic factors from for cell survival and then bone growth molecules and their receptors things like bone morphogenetic proteins and things like that to induce cells to proliferate and differentiate into cartilage and bone so here you can see cells can be derived from the soft tissues from the periosteum we talked about before and also the endosteum now the extracellular matrix is a structure is some tight function is to provide structure sort of a space and a surface for adhesion of cells so it's a framework essentially and a mechanical environment for healing and it's composed of collagen fibres non collagenous proteins growth factors and minerals now if you're trying to get a fracture to heal and you have literally a large gap with no extracellular matrix sometimes you can use bone graft materials like patients bone transpose basically transplanted from elsewhere in that and the patients from the patient's body to an area where you have a need or bone bone bank or a commercially available products like hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate calcium sulfates the board supply as I mentioned is essential for successful healing it's a key for cells nutrients and growth factors and the bone only forms where there's a blood supply so if you don't have a blood supply if not going to form bone angiogenesis coordinates the conversion of cartilage to bone during endochondral ossification and disruption leads to interruption of healing so there's a whole host of molecules growth factors and their receptors I kind of highlighted bone morphogenetic proteins here because these are actually commercially available products that you can use to potentially assist your fracture to heal that you may hear about all right welcome back I'm sakea bran from Temple University Hospital and going on to the second part of our lecture on fracture healing and repair and just to recap in the first portion we went through the basic bone biology uh stages of fracture repair what you need for fractures to heal such as extracellular Matrix cells uh vascular Supply uh bone growth uh factors and um few things about when fractures don't heal or when you have uh some abnormalities and how we can treat them and now we're going to talk more about um clinical aspect so any clinical evaluation starts with a history and typically fractures are going to be traumatic uh so you have to elicit some history that there was an injury or fall or something like that um it could be at traumatic so for instance if you have a bone tumor that's one example uh where where the bone is itself is abnormal and gives way without any obvious trauma or stress to the Bone uh typically it's going to be pain all right so uh um when you're assessing someone and you're worried about a fracture and they don't really have pain then they probably don't have a fracture uh unless they don't have pain for some reason like they're paralyzed um they may say they heard a crack they're usually going to have some type of immediate disability especially if it's a displaced fracture so you on inspection so now you go on to a physical examination inspection you want to look for deformity swelling ecosis I mean it's not always this obvious where there's an open wound and maybe you see a bone coming through or something but um certainly these are some of the things you want to look for and certainly palpation this is really critical okay so with with displaced grossly angulated unstable fractures I mean you may not even have to do this uh in every case and say hey this is it hurt here where someone's bone is coming through the skin so but if you have somebody who twisted their ankle and you're not sure uh you want to make sure that do they have tenderness at the fracture side right on the bone so for instance for the ankle if they have tenderness over the ligaments but not really on the bone well then maybe it's an ankle sprain okay so so when an orthopedic examinations the findings are very somatic or pain is somatic so it's not for instance like when somebody's having a heart attack and you can't just put a finger right on their chest right over where the myocardial inunction is happening and say well does it hurt right there no they say you know I feel like there's a weight or a crushing feeling or your arm starts to hurt or you know no when you have a fracture you can point right to exactly where the pain is almost with the finger that's very important for for clinical exam um purposes um you want to look for instability you want to see if there's painful ring range of motion if it's near a joint for instance and maybe you want to check for pulses that maybe you should uh but maybe there's an impaired pulse I I should say uh you want to do a detailed neurologic examination where uh you uh check for sensation uh reflexes muscle tone motor exam we'll certainly get to that and why that's important so going on with your evaluation you want to look at Imaging right so fractures want an x-ray right so plane radiographs are us usually sufficient especially for long bones like this uh you want 9090 views so you want like for instance an AP and a lateral for ex for instance uh in an extremity like this uh you want to make sure you see a joint above and Joint below and I won't get too much into that but you rotate with us clinical you'll see the uh importance of that sometimes you need a CT scan so CT scans are like X-rays and they're very good for looking at bone um you don't always need it so you probably don't need it for this but you do need it if there's a fracture going into a joint um and some bones that are just not as easily imaged with two-dimensional uh x-rays like the pelvis or maybe the scapula and it can be helpful for pre-operative planning and sometimes you actually need an MRI or nuclear Imaging like a bone scan uh in order to find an occult fracture so something you don't even see on x-ray but you're really convinced that there's a fracture maybe because they have point tenness right on that spot so what about treatment well bone heals Itself by regenerating new bone tissue rather than healing with scar tissue so if you think about other organs or tissues uh skin for instance uh when you cut yourself you get a scar or when you lacerate your um I don't know um muscle tissue or we talked about a heart attack before I mean when you get uh you you get fibrosis you get Scar Tissue all right so it's not really new tissue that organ had before it's now Scar Tissue but bone if it healed with scar tissue you'd never be able to restore stability and function again so the body obviously has a mechanism to make new bone now we can assist it in optimizing fracture alignment what we call reduction uh articular alignment length rotation and we can also help optimize the local environment perhaps and those treatment options are close reduction and casting shown here uh open reduction internal fixation shown here like a plate and screw type device you don't see the screws here but this is an example of a metal plate that we may put on the surface of the bone and then put screws through it external fixation SE in here this is a uh for instance tiia where you have pins and this is a device where the the device actually is outside the skin okay it's external fixation and then you have something like intramed rotting so for instance instead of treating whatever this let's say patient had a tibia fracture and instead of treating in a cast you actually take this rod and go inside intram medular so it's inside the medular canal and sometimes you have to do arthroplasty or replacement and that's typically for a fractured articular surface for instance the femoral head is a good example or humeral head um and you'd have to do a partial joint replacement or a full joint replacement so casting is indicated when fracture alignment is an acceptable alignment okay and you may use plaster here you have a splint but this can also be a cast like shown in the in the last photograph open reduction internal fixation is when you do a surgery and go in or you open and reduction means you put the pieces back in place and internal fixation and this is something that is done when near anatomic or anatomic reduction meaning putting something together perfectly a fracture alignment is necessary to restore function and this is something that um certain bones uh is necessarily certainly articular fractures um other fractures that's done very commonly would be like the forearm um it's often done in the humeral diaphysis um and here's an example in the scaphoid for instance external fixation is indicated when fracture is in acceptable alignment and or maybe the limbs condition is not amenable to open surgical intervention so let's let's take for example this patient had this elbow rure dislocation and it was an open wound and it was a vascular injury and you have to go to O immediately but you really you're not equipped prepared or you don't feel the patient ready necessarily to do this reconstruction of the articular surfaces so you can do a temporizing external fixtor and sometimes an external fixtor can be definitive management we're not going to get into all the nuances of this uh but just so you know what the devices are for instance ined rotting is indicated when only gross fracture alignment is necessary to restore function so you don't need to get things perfectly uh but uh for instance in the um diaphysis and the lower extremity so in the tibbi and femur this is a very common technique and tends to work very well whereas um in the upper extremities we tend to do open reduction internal fixation and with plate and screws more often but I mean this can this is a incredibly successful Tech technique for fractures in the femur for instance and arthroplasty could be done when uh articular fractures uh are not salvageable this is maybe not the best example but let's just say you had a fracture in the radial head where this piece was off and there was another piece off here and the neck was fractured and the whole joint was unstable so you had to provide some immediate stability well that's where you can just throw this in the trash essentially this goes out and then you replace it with this metal head with a little stem that goes inside and you can imagine the femoral head for instance it's probably the most common place you see this done where people get hip replacement sometimes for certain fractures Associated neurovascular injury so remember fractures don't occur in isolation Okay and some people even say that a fracture is a soft tissue injury with a broken bone um so just to kind of relay the importance of that and it's important to know that neurovascular injury is not always obvious and I have to say I mean I really don't like it when people say neurovascularly intact it really implies that everything's intact and you've checked everything it's always better to document what you saw what actually uh uh was working or not working so it requires careful and repeated examination um because these things can change over time someone may have a pulse when they come in and now they don't have a pulse or someone radial nerve was working or you know their uh sciatic nerve was working and now it's not working um Associated neurovascular injury uh you know this this is important also because it can potentially uh um lead to um limb threatening problems so if you have vascular injury certainly uh somebody can lose their limb from this uh keep in mind nerve injury requ requires patient cooperation so if you have an intubated patient or a patient who's unable to communicate for whatever reason they just had a stroke um you can't or maybe stroke is not a great example but they they're comos for some reason uh they may you know you may not be able to get a good uh nerve assessment um and uh compartment syndrome I'm going to go over uh shortly and this is something you absolutely don't want to miss vascular injuries uh can occur from penetrating or blunt trauma they require immediate diagnosis and treatment so here you have an example of somebody with some open distal femur fracture and you can see the uh poal artery kind of come to a halt right about here and just it stops you got some collateral circulation but that's a problem tissue death can occur within hours with warm memia and it requires early involvement by vascular surgeon as I mentioned neurologic injury requires a Cooperative patient it needs very careful and repeated exam um you could have uh different stages of nerve injury where you have either neuropraxia uh with just sensory deficits or accent at mesis with sensory and motor deficits uh where surgery might be needed neurotmesis um uh which is when you just have the nerve severed essentially and in those cases there's no continuity and it will require surgery so compartment syndrome I'm kind of mentioned this was really important you don't want to miss it this is basically when you have increased intracompartmental pressure so this is something that's seen often in the lower leg uh it's also seen in the forearm uh these are just two of the areas where it but it happens the most but it can also happen in the thigh can also happen in the Glu muscles and the upper arm um but uh common locations with the lower leg leg and the forearm so it's due to fracture um or some kind of severe soft tissue injury causes this increased pressure and when I say compartment you're talking about uh the you know fasal compartments in the in um the extremity okay that have these sort of tight confines uh it can be due to prolonged pressure or prolonged hypo profusion to the limb so somebody has a vascular injury they're not PR freezing their limb they can get a compartment syndrome or somebody who's been in an earth earthquake and something's laying on top of their leg Crush injury that can lead to compartment syndrome and this is a tissue esea that can lead to muscle death all right and it's a surgical emergency all right and this is very important if you make a diagnosis it requires an immediate fasciotomy procedure like is shown here in this picture in the operating room so the clinical signs are the so-called five PS of pain okay especially pain with passive range of motion and pain out of proportion to what you would normally expect paresthesias paralysis palour pulselessness okay and you can't measure most of these in an obtunded and intubated patient or somebody who you can't communicate with for instance somebody with a psychiatric problem uh you also have to be very careful with someone who has a different language or culture uh where perhaps their pain is being expressed differently or there maybe they're more stoic and and they don't speak your language so or and in children sometimes they can't communicate this well and they just seem anxious um you can get some objective uh findings with with compartment pressure measurements so um if you have pressures greater than 30 that could possibly be a compartment syndrome but a more reliable uh finding is a Delta P or socalled diastolic pressure minus compartment pressure of less than 30 mm Mercury and to get these pressure measurements you literally have to stick a device into the compartment uh and we have these special devices with a needle that goes in and checks the pressure as I said these most commonly occur in the leg and forearm they can also occur in the thigh foot arm hand buttock uh patient who's found down and we use that term when we find patients who have drug overdoses or alcohol um intoxication and they're just laying down for hours and hours is in an awkward position and it's a surgical emergency misdiagnosis can lead to uh permanent muscle death contractures and U lawsuits so we'll wrap up by talking a little bit about fractured nonunion so we talked all about this stuff about how you know fractures occur how they heal um and now we'll talk a little bit about when they don't heal and um this can occur essentially when a fracture doesn't heal and the patient will have pain uh they'll have persistent pain so like you know they they still have pain at that fracture site months and months later uh there may be tenderness directly over the fracture non-union site uh you may see a persistent fracture line as is shown here now you still have this this uh line in fact in this case the line has extended Beyond where you would think is the normal outline of bone and it's even extended out into here right um and remember what's needed for fracture healing cells extra cellular matri matrix blood supply molecules and growth factors and mechanical stability right so if anything goes wrong with any of these things here you can potentially get a non-union okay so an atropic non-union these are some terms you should be familiar with uh is when you have a lack of any of those things for instance lack of or I should say lack of the biologic requirements okay so just not making bone because you don't have cells you don't have extra cell Matrix you don't have blood supply or combination of those things and it needs what's called a bone grafting so we often have to take bone and transplanted maybe from somewhere else in the body the iliac crest in the pelvis the Fe the femur meary Canal are two such sources that uh sometimes we use but they can be obtained from many places in the body this is that example I showed in the last slide where you have you can have a hypertrophic non-union and it's the the biologies there so in this case you can see it's this you know this little lump out here is some evidence and over here that the body's trying to make bone but it just can't Bridge across here because there's so much motion the fracture can't stabilize itself and heel so it just needs better stability so it may not need bone graft it just needs something to hold that from moving until it has a chance to for this bone to just kind of bridge across okay if you have a lack of extracel Matrix like this fracture here you have this massive massive Gap right um and sometimes just large defects like that won't heal there there's nothing to heal onto you don't have that sort of structure to to for cells and growth factors to get started so here you can perform bone grafting to provide that scaffold an osteoconductive scaffold it's term we use for bone to grow onto now you can also have a lack of growth factors this one's a little bit hard to diagnose some sometimes um I mean this could be a case where that's the that's happening um growth factors can be administered to a fracture non-union as a form of treatment when you bone graft somebody you're getting some of those growth factors but these are also some commercially available products we can use or poor vascular Supply now this can occur in smokers diabetics sometimes um uh you may need to bring vascularized bone uh to help this to heal and sometimes you need to reestablish you can see this you know this cortex coming down and then it's kind of sclerosed off here and then here you can see that you're not getting this meary blood supply so if you sort of open this up you can allow the intramed blood supply to be restored and one other thing is infection infection can also prevent a fracture from healing um and lack of mechanical stability so this is not really a biologic Factor so much it's more of a mechanical factor and here's where you can get for instance another hypertrophic non-union so you can see lots of bone you know being made all this extra bone out here this irregular appearance but you can see that this crack just hasn't gone away the patient still has pain so the biology is there but the bone just can't Bridge across that fractor site due to motion so it needs to be stabilized I mean you go in and just stabilize this and doesn't need bone graft and you can often get that to heal so brings us to the end uh and just to recap again our uh lecture objectives were to understand the proper assessment of fractures which we covered a little bit more in this half of the lecture understand the basic management of uh fractures which we talked about also understand why some fractures don't heal and if you understood everything in the first lecture on the basics uh and basics of fracture healing and then we talked about non-unions at the end of this hopefully that links it together and now you can understand why some fractures don't heal and then to understand complications and Associated injuries we talked about some neurovascular injury we talked about compartment syndrome um and you should be aware of those also all right thank you very much please don't uh hesitate to contact me if you have questions and um if you're listening to this uh you know that uh this is on the ortho clips.com website and uh this is also at uh my if you go on YouTube and uh you type in orthoclips as a search it's got to be one word and if you uh click on it it might default to two words where you won't find this uh but if you redirect it to orthoclips you'll see there's a uh Channel where there's tons of these instructional videos and um enjoy thanks all right this is our shoulder disorders presentation I'm dr",
  "Leslie Barnes and I will be presenting shoulder arthritis and treatment for that rotator cuff tears and associated diagnosis and treatment for that and rotator cuff tear arthropathy as well the most important thing of course is to know your Anatomy and that includes all the nerves and vessels around the shoulder the front and the back of the shoulder highlighting here you know the brachial plexus and the axillary nerve here the conjoint tendon has been removed and we're looking at the subscapularis tendon the superspinatus and how it attaches to the greater tuberosity versus the subscapular to the lesser tuberosity and they are divided by the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove as you can see here and also important to note that the conjoint engine which attaches to the coracoid process is an important surface landmark and we call it basically the Lighthouse of the shoulder because it helps to orient you and guide you relative to the other anatomical structures that you're looking for such as the tendons and vessels moving on to our first topic shoulder arthritis we always start with the history and thorough physical examination on history or talking to the patients you will find that they were usually report insidious onset meaning that it's happened slow and overtime there's typically not acute trauma associated but they may have some low-energy trauma that has exacerbated their condition they typically report pain and crepitus which is crunching or grinding of the shoulder upon shoulder motion and of course limited motion as a result of the crepitus and the best way to sometimes describe crepitus to patients is that it's sort of like driving on a flat tire where the axle of the wheel is bent and you're not really gliding or rolling down the street the way you typically would but you're rather bumping and grinding your way along on any uneven surface and that's kind of the best way to describe what shoulder arthritis feels like because as the cartilage wears away it doesn't typically wear away in a smooth even pattern it becomes disfigured and the normally congruent bone socket joint which glides smoothly then becomes disfigured by the arthritis and those secondary changes caused pain and limited motion radiographic findings include joint space narrowing osteophytes or reactive bone formation which you can see here on the inferior portion of the humerus is an osteophyte which has formed in response to abnormal contact stresses a subchondral assists you can see here on both the glenoid side and the humeral head side and subchondral sclerosis which is a paradoxical hardening of the bone right here along the edges that's represented by a relative increase in calcium density on the x-ray or a white line on the x-ray and then just below that are those previously mentioned assists which are pockets of air and dead bone basically in terms of specific radiographic views to get you're looking for the true AP of the shoulder which is where the anterior and posterior rims of the glenoid are superimposed and that typically requires about a 30 or 40 degree a tilt to the beam and you can either tilt the patient or tilt the beam but that's the best way to align yourself with the typical the glenoid and get the best x-rays in addition to the true AP you're gonna want to get an axillary x-ray which shoots the beam in an orthogonal fashion to the AP up through the axilla in terms of non operative treatment options for patients they include anti-inflammatory medication activity modification or resting the shoulder generally a cortisone injection which is anti-inflammatory in nature and for arthritis that would typically go inside the actual glenohumeral joint as opposed to in the rotator cuff or subacromial bursa and other than those three main tools you can either leave it alone or go forward with surgery if the symptoms are bad enough and the patient wants to go forward in terms of surgical treatment options we're looking at total shoulder replacement which in medical jargon is total shoulder arthroplasty or reconstruction of the joint what hapens is that you cut out all the arthritis you replace the socket with a plastic socket component that you can see here this particular one is a polyethylene socket with three pegs holding the implant into the glenoid vault and those are typically cemented in and then on the humeral side you can see that the humerus arm bone is removed at the surgical neck and the arthritis is all removed and resurfaced by this metal cap which has a corresponding post that goes into the hollow part of the arm bone and that can be either cemented in as is most traditional or it can be unsubmitted using the newer trabecular metal prosthetics there are even some designs currently under research that have a very short stem or no stem at all but the typical implant design that has been around the longest with the longest record record is the one that you see here which is a cemented stem in terms of our anatomical exposure we're looking at the anterior part of the shoulder and you're looking for a standard Delta pectoral approach and again this goes back to our important relevant mat anatomy as outlined in the beginning but you're gonna find the coracoid as a surface landmark and you're gonna make your incision basically just lateral to the coracoid or sometimes right over it either in a vertical fashion for a limited approach or in the slightly diagonal incision that you see here which is an extended Delta pectoral approach and that actually allows for extension down the entire arm if needed once you incise the skin you'll come to the Delta pectoral fascia and that interval will be demarcated by the cephalic vein which is identified here in the cartoon once you have freed adhesions from the cephalic vein you can then mobilize the vein medially or laterally as long as you take care to preserve the vein as best as possible and ligate any feeding branches to the deltoid when you're mobilizing the vessel once the vessel is mobilized you can then find the biceps tendon which we reported was essentially in the center of the arm bone in the bicipital groove and once that's in size you will then see the subscapularis tendon the best in order to gain access to the shoulder joint you will need to cut the subscapularis tendon either through a sharp incision like a tenotomy that's shown here using a knife blade or sometimes you will even take the subscapularis tendon off the shoulder using an osteotome to elevate a small piece of bone the lesser tuberosity where the subscapularis tendon attaches and instead of cutting the tendon off the bone you'll actually split the bone and take that off the front of the shoulder and that will give you access to the shoulder joint in order to perform the operation and again here you can see a completed total shoulder replacement you have here a radiolucent marker which shows you the orientation of the cemented polyethylene liner and that is the only radio opaque portion of the liner for the socket but you can faintly see here the outlines of the other pegs and then the new joint surface over here on the humeral side you'll see that the humeral head is nicely centered within the glenoid andin terms of this circle that will give us the center of rotation which we want to be approximately as anatomic as possible and that will help you determine whether the shoulder is the appropriate size for the patient's anatomy moving on to our next section of the talk regarding the rotator cuff tendons remember that the acronym for this is the Sitz tendons that's the supraspinatus infraspinatus the teres minor and the subscapularis all which you can see here in the cartoon and the subscapularis tendon is delineate adhere in the front-running anterior in the shoulder and attaching to the lesser tuberosity the biceps tendon the long head runs between that and the supraspinatus tendon which you can see here on the anterior portion of the greater tuberosity confluent with that is the infraspinatus tendon and very posterior is the teres minor on evaluation of rotator cuff pathology the history and physical exam you're going to often notice a trauma especially for younger patients and this may be related to sporting activity or false in older patients however there may not be a cute trauma and may be very minimal trauma and maybe picking up a grandchild or there may be a no trauma history at all and this is because of mild rotator cuff degeneration over time which diminishes the blood supply and therefore the tendon quality and that can be the factor for low-energy tears any older patient the patient will describe weakness with overhead activity especially reaching overhead reaching for objects in the home lifting things such as groceries or a high-energy patient or high active patient may notice weakness with their sport or activity of interest throwing sports especially tennis sometimes golf and things of that nature pain is also a frequent associating factor they may have pain especially at nighttime but the most telling sign is pain with attempted overhead activity this distinguishes it from other conditions such as pain at rest which may be something else on imaging you're gonna always start with x-ray evaluation especially if there's a history of trauma but notably on x-rays you will not see a fracture or dislocation you in many cases will not see any arthritis and contrast that to our previous picture here is a smooth articular surface there's a joint space and the overall outline of the humerus is preserved and smooth here on the humeral side notice in this x-ray that there's a preserved acromial humeral interval which is the space between the humerus and the acromion there are conditions in which this interval is narrowed and I'll get to that a little bit later but in that space which you can't see on the x-ray is where the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons live and since this space is preserved presumably the tendons are intact as well therefore our advanced imaging will be needed and that typically involves an MRI scan an MRI scan what you're going to be looking for is the tear size where the tear puts the tendons and that's known as retraction so is the tendon edge just sitting at the tear site is the tendon and retracted medially and if so how far medially is at 1 centimeter medial to the articular surface is it beyond the articular surface so glenohumeral joint or is it retracted way beyond the glenohumeral joint medial to the glenoid vault and the final thing you're going to notice can is the tendon quality is the tissue have any degeneration has atrophy occurred atrophy is a sign of fatty infiltration and this occurs over time and it gives you a sense of the tendon quality and whether the tear is fixable here's a representative image of an MRI scan you're looking at a t2 coronal MRI scan you can see here that the tendon is outline in dark black however here the tendon stops and it's replaced by would and this is typically what one slice of a tear will look like here's a lower edge of the tendon so you would describe this as a full thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon and it's retracted to the level of the articular surface and that will be the most descriptive evidence for that in terms of tear size that's determined based on serial slices of the MRI scan so the MRI basically takes a picture of the rotator cuff every several millimeters and that's determined by the cut thickness or the MRI scan but every several millimeters is taking a picture and if you count how many times the tear appears on sequential pictures you can then add up the tear size in terms of anteroposterior diameter of the tear tendon quality would be identified on the sagittal views and that would be again looking for fatty infiltration of the tendon which shows up as white streaks in the tendon essentially as fat treatment options for rotator cuff tears include non operative and operative treatment options in terms of avoiding surgery you have three main tools and those involved anti-inflammatory medication if the patient is able to take them physical therapy program and that is done to strengthen the other muscles around the shoulder actually it does not strengthen the torn tendon because the tore tendon cannot be activated if it is not attached to the humerus the other modality to treat rotator cuff tears non-operatively involves a cortisone injection and that's the subacromial cortisone injection meaning that it goes below the acromion into the bursa just above the rotator cuff area and it's done to cooldown inflammation cortisone injection does not heal the tear but it makes it tear more tolerable and many patients can live with a rotator cuff tear as long as their pain level is low if their pain is controlled many patients with a small tear may choose to live with it however if they cannot complete their activities of daily living they have weakness they have persistent pain that is not permanently controlled by the cortisone injection they will then ask about surgical intervention in terms of surgical intervention what you're actually going to do is repair the rotator cuff we use stitches pass through the tendons and then we tack it down to the arm bone typically using plastic surgery plastic suture anchors in the past that the original suture anchors were made of metal it can be done open or arthroscopically and in the open method an incision is made over the shoulder and dissection is carried down through the deltoid muscle and the tendons are directly visualized in arthroscopy a camera is put into the shoulder joint and also above the shoulder joint into the subacromial space and fluid is pumped through the shoulder in order to expand the area and that gives you good visualization the rest of the surgery is then done through small cannulas or poke hole incisions and specialized instruments are used to pass suture and to place the anchors here is an arthroscopic image looking at a torn rotator cuff this Anatomy is the same obviously as the open anatomy however it can look very different under the camera so here is the rotator cuff edge and here is the humerus bone here so again here's the under surface of the rotator cuff tendon which is torn and it should be attached to the greater tuberosity these stitches are then passed through the rotator cuff each one of these is a fiber wire suture pass through the tendon and then the knots are tied here each one has a knot and that because these suture limbs are threaded through a suture anchor down here that's already been tacked into the arm bone once those limbs are tied securely that reattaches this tendon edge and here you can see the tendon edges here and it's just opposed to where it should be covering the bone here on the left is the torn image where the tendon is elevated and on the right you can see that it's been captured by the suture and it's now drawn back to the suture anchor attacked to the arm bone and you can do a variety of repair methods which you'll see in the or and those are single row or in this case this is a double row which involves a knot here and the sutures are then taken back in a crisscross fashion through a second row of anchors out laterally and this is for larger tears thought to help with healing potential it's somewhat debated but the thought process or the idea behind this repair technique is that there's a medial row of compression and then there's added compression or tendon opposition using this parachute or network of suture to further compress the tendon edge and try to get it to reattach or heal or stay adjacent to the arm bone to allow the arm to be activated in forward all of a moving on to our next section which is cuff tear arthropathy now this is what happens when a large rotator cuff tear is not treated for a variety of reasons either because it occurred solely over time or because the chair was so massive at the time of diagnosis that it was not fixable and these tears can create abnormal biomechanics within the shoulder so what happens is that that a chromeo humeral interval that we talked about before is reduced so this shoulder here has superior migration it's called it comes almost it's not out of the socket but it comes high within the socket and it starts to touch the under surface of the acromion and there can be varying degrees of of this finding where the the interval may be reduced by just a couple of millimeters or it may be completely eliminated and humeral head is now articulating with the directly with the under surface of the acromion and this again occurs in the presence of a massive rotator cuff tear where the space that's normally occupied by the rotator cuff is now eliminated because the rotator cuff is torn and retracted here medially and the space instead fills with fluid and gradually the arm bone floats up into that space or potential space and as a result the shoulder elevation biomechanics are altered the biggest problem that you see here is the deltoid becomes loses its tension and that's depicted in this cartoon by the wavy lines of the pre-existing deltoid and that occurs as a result of the superior migration over time these altered biomechanics will then lead to arthritis on history and physical exam you'll note again an insidious onset meaning it happens typically over time patients can't pinpoint one day where it all of a sudden happened they will have pain that's are usually biggest complaint and what goes along with pain is crepitus and that's again the grinding of the arthritis the arm bone is no longer semicircular the socket is no longer smooth and arthritis results in addition to pain a unique finding - cuff tear arthropathy is pseudo paralysis and that's what this patient here in this picture is trying to do he's trying to forward elevate his arm but instead he is giving us a shoulder shrug and that's telling us that there is no activation of the rotator cuff muscles and it seems as if the arm is paralyzed however the herbs are working fully and if you wanted to confirm that of course you'd get an EMG if you had any doubt or a nerve test but you would find that the nerves are actually working so it's not true paralysis its pseudo paralysis because in a large rotator cuff here and here are the radiographic findings which is humeral head migration there's no ocurro humeral interval this is the center of the glenoid vault which is supposed to articulate with the center of the humeral head and that's now elevated and there are some signs of arthritis here which are some osteophytes forming marginal osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis or joint space narrowing as well the treatment options not involving surgery again are anti-inflammatory medications therapy or cortisone injections and in this case for surgery with a tear that's not fixable and when arthritis has a card you're going to replace the whole shoulder however you're not going to do a standard total shoulder replacement like we discussed at the beginning of the talk you're gonna do what's called a reverse shoulder replacement and what's reversed about it is that you'll see here that the socket is now on the arm bone and that's this plastic dish and the ball has now been moved to the socket side that's typically anchored in with two metal screws and a trabecular metal post and then the socket is then replaced with a semicircular ball on the arm bone again is the plastic socket now switch to the humeral side and that's associated with a metal stem which is typically cemented but can be unsymmetric what this does is it changes the center of rotation instead of being superiorly elevated in the altered anatomy with the rotator cuff tear it's now dist alized and medial eyes and that helps to activate the deltoid and now the deltoid is used to forward elevate the arm instead of the rotator cuff which is non-functional and here's a post-operative appearance on x-ray of the typical rotator cuff deficient replacement which again is the reverse shoulder replacement and here you can see the semi-circular ball part with its post two middle screws anchoring it into the glenoid and on the humorous side you can see the plastic is of course radiolucent and here is the metal post going down the arm bone and this white cloudy material outside of it is the cement and on the humorous side that's the cemented humeral component on the glenoid side it's a base plate with a Glennis fear and that's the end of our topics which we've covered today including shoulder arthritis rotator cuff tears and massive rotator cuff tears with arthritis known as rotator cuff arthropathy thank you very much this is a brief introduction to the anterior cruciate ligament uh there's certainly a significant amount written about the anterior cruciate ligament a PubMed search will provide 177,000 results of Articles written about the Anor cruciate ligament over the last roughly 40 years uh with the vast majority of them written in the last 10 years but this overview is going to be a brief review of the anatomy of the knee the anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament and considerations when uh it comes to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction uh as well as uh Rehabilitation to begin with knee Anatomy the knee is a modified hinge joint whose obvious function is flexion and extension however there's also varis and valgus uh movement about the knee which is uh Inward and outward motion of the distal tibia I'm sorry of the tbia uh in the coronal plane as well as axial rotation the Bony anatomy of the knee is such that the medial femal cond is slightly larger and more distal which also creates a little rotation uh in the course of knee flection and extension uh also of note is that the lateral tibial Plateau is convex and therefore incongruent uh and the knee relies on the lateral meniscus to provide some congruence within the lateral compartment in evaluation of the anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament this figure demonstrates the concept of a four bar linkage between the anterior and posterior Cru shits but the anterior creu [ __ ] is uh typically about 33 mm long from its femoral origin to its tibial insertion uh but with a relatively significant range of 25 mm to 41 mm uh its average diameter is roughly 10 mm uh that ranges from 12 mm at the femoral origin uh and potentially even more at the tibial insertion uh to approximately 7 millim at its midpoint as it has an hourglass shape in the ephemeral attachment uh there is a semicircular area uh that the anterior cruciate ligament originates from on the posterior medial aspect of the lateral femoral cond and the Anor cruciate ligament runs within the interc cond notch with the knee fully extended as you can see on the right side of the image the uh fibers of the anterior cruciate ligament are parallel to each other however with the knee Flex at 90° which is often how the ACL is viewed at arthroscopy these fibers crisscross and the major bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament as will be described a little bit later uh are seen uh uh more in that Twisted fashion the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament is seen in uh yellow in the image on the right uh it's a broad regular oval-shaped area that sits between the interc cond eminences of the tibia uh just just behind the uh intermeniscal ligament uh the posterior cruciate ligament inserts more posteriorly just off of the edge of the tibial plateau and actually inserts well beneath the uh level of the tibial plate approximately 1 cimeter below the joint line the anterior cruet is made up of 90% type1 collagen and 10% type 3 collagen uh and is interated by the posterior articular nerve which is a branch of the tibial nerve as it traverses the papal faasa uh the anterior cruet also has meano receptors uh and this helps it in its propriate receptive role uh in giving neural feedback to the brain about where the knee is in space it's major blood supply uh for both the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments uh are uh branches of the middle geniculate artery as touched upon previously the ACL is composed of two separate bundles and these are named for their tibial insertion sites there's a smaller intermedial bundle that you can see inserts uh distal to the where this is labeled anterior and medial on the tibial insertion and a larger more bulky poster lateral bundle uh that crosses behind the antr medial bundle when the knee is flexed from head-on uh which is the view most often seen arthroscopically the antral bundle sits over top of the posterolateral bundle when the knee is flexed uh you can see that the intometal bundle uh takes its femoral origin uh slightly more posteriorly uh and superiorly uh I'm sorry slightly more superiorly uh which is more posterior in this image the poster lateral bundle takes its origin uh slightly more uh inferior on this image which reflects more posteriorly in the extended knee as mentioned with the knee in extension uh the intermedial and posterolateral bundles are oriented parallel to one another uh but they cross when the knee is flexed the uh intometal bundle is the tighter bundle when the knee is flexed and the poster lateral bundle tightens an extension making it uh the more important of the bundles in terms of function of the ACL as most athletic activities occur uh at or near extension of the knee traditional single bundle reconstructions of the ACL uh typically mimic the function of the anomal bundle only although the tunnels uh historically had been placed uh in a mismatch with the intermedial uh femoral bundle and the posterolateral tibial insertion and so the traditional single bundle reconstructions uh may not restore uh rotational stability uh double bundle reconstructions uh may be better at restoring rotational kinematics but it remains controversial as far as whether that is clinically important uh and whether it does improve functional outcomes greatly to perform a double bundle reconstruction in terms of biomechanics of the ligament uh we evaluate the tensile strength uh which is the maximal stress that a ligament can sustain before failure uh in this case under tension the native anterior cruciate ligament uh can uh sustain approximately 2,200 Newtons of force before failure uh which is roughly equal to the PCL which is uh slightly stronger at 2500 Newtons the MCL uh is substantially stronger than the ACL able to withstand approximately 4,000 Newtons of force and the lateral collateral ligament uh can only withstand 750 Newtons of force uh in isolation there are certainly other structures that uh support the lateral collateral ligament uh and increase overall strength to a stress uh in evaluating the graphs that are used for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction a 10 mm patellar tendon graft can withstand 2900 Newtons of force however we also have to evaluate the uh strength of the uh bone tendon interface uh and the bone blocks of the pellar tendon graft uh heal with bone to- bone heel healing after approximately 6 weeks the quadrupled hamstring graft uh can withstand 4,000 Newtons of force before failure uh however it is greatly dependent on graph fixation and the strength of that graft fixation within the femal and tibial tunnels and soft tissue healing uh of The graft within the tunnels takes approximately 10 to 12 weeks the functional role of the anterior cruciate ligament is that it is the primary restraint to uh anterior translation of the proximal tibia especially with the knee and slight flexion uh it's a secondary restraint to tibial rotation as well as to varus and vus stress the ACL has a complex arrangement of fibers and although we identify two separate bundles there are thousands of uh collagen fibers within each of those bundles that all act relatively independently this Arrangement however allows the ACL to have VIs elastic properties this means that the uh uh strength of the uh ligament is dependent on the rate at which it is loaded uh and that there is some ability uh for the ligament to stretch slightly uh this provides for some amount of flexibility the ACL also serves appropriate receptive function uh as mentioned when discussing mechano receptor fibers uh and it is considered to be the sensory organ of the knee uh in the United States approximately 250,000 anterior cruet ligament ruptures occur uh each year uh making the incidents approximately 1 and 3,000 uh there are 100,000 reconstructions performed each year in the United States 70% of all Anor cruciate injuries are secondary to sports activities with the remainder coming from other high energy uh injuries such as knee dislocations or uh injuries with motor vehicle accidents uh or other uh uh relatively uh violent or high energy injuries uh the highest risk of injury with athletic event is with skiing and with soccer and women are uh at greater risk than men are in most sports including in basketball volleyball and soccer where there's about a three to four time higher incidence of uh or higher rate of anterior cruciate ligament rupture uh in women relative to men all ACL ruptures are accute injuries uh as there is no such thing as a uh overuse type of anterior cruciate rupture uh there are also acute on chronic injuries of the ACL in uh patients who have tried to rehab a torn or partially torn ACL but certainly all ACL ruptures are just that traumatic ruptures the typical uh history from a patient is that they have uh pain and Rapid swelling of the knee after feeling a pop typically uh in a non- contct setting when their knee is in a slightly flexed and valgus position uh certainly the ACL can be ruptured with a contact injury as well however a picture to the right is Dr Joseph Tor who's a member of the temple faculty uh he was uh the author of a paper in 19 1976 published in the American Journal of sports medicine uh titled the clinical diagnosis of ACL instability in the athlete uh this was the first published description of the lochman test which is uh now the uh standard test performed for evaluation of an anterior cruciate ligament rupture the test is performed by slightly flexing the knee to approximately 30° and stabilizing the distal femur with uh the inner hand as the outer hand uh translates the proximal tibia anteriorly uh interestingly within that article Dr Tor quoted Dr Fred Alman who said that an ACL injury is the beginning of the end of the knee uh at the time the anterior cruciate ligament was a controversial structure with most people feeling that this was a vestigal Structure similar to the appendix serving no function uh and a small group of vocal Sports Medicine surgeons uh uh stating that uh a neglected rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament would most certainly lead to endstage arthritic changes and so Dr Tor was one of the Pioneers in uh arguing for uh anterior cruciate reconstruction to restore function uh as well as at the time thinking that this would Stave off the progression of arthritis that we've since found out that it may be the injury itself that will predispose a patient to arthritis and not necessarily whether they have their anterior Cru reconstructed or not from an arthoscopic view uh with the arthroscope in the femoral Notch uh this probe is around the ruptured part of an anterior cruciate ligament you can see the uh hemorrhagic stump uh remaining of the uh a another uh way to evaluate the anterior cruciate ligament uh is to uh evaluate the uh medial wall lateral femal condo uh and demonstrate that in this circumstance although there is a significant amount of ACL tissue behind the probe uh certainly at least the poster lateral uh bundle origin has been uh ruptured and in placing the orthoscope into the opposite portal and looking directly on the lateral femoral cond uh you can see the uh anterior Cru ship uh and this is an arthoscopic image after an anterior cruciate reconstruction where you can see the uh graft extending as an anterior cruciate ligament would from the uh more posterior aspect of the femoral coni as seen with the KNE in flexion down to its tibial insertion in terms of how this is performed there's uh multiple graft options uh including using uh a patient's own tissue whether it's their patellar tendon or their hamstring tendons or in some circumstances their quadriceps tendon uh or using donated cavic tissue uh and there's also different options with regard to how the that graft is fixed to the femur and the tibia and in this slide you can see the options ranging from an interference screw uh in the top left where the screw is uh uh securing The graft within the femoral tunnel uh in the middle and the top right are uh devices uh which uh penetrate across the bone across the tunnel uh securing The graft within the tunnel and then on the bottom left uh which demonstrates uh a cortical button where the graft is looped through the suture that is seen here and the button itself is uh drawn through the tunnel uh and placed onto the outer aspect of the lateral cortex uh where it suspends the uh graft on the tibial side the typical fixation as seen in the center is a tibial interference screw uh sometimes supplemented with uh another way to fix uh sutures from The graft uh more distal to the tunnel and of course of uh equal importance to the manner in which the interior cruciate ligament is reconstructed uh the rehabilitation of the uh patient who's had an ACL reconstruction uh really does go a long way in determining whether that person is going to get back to their usual activities whether it's athletic or just activities of daily living and so the goals after anterior cruciate reconstruction uh although there's many ways to get there and many different protocols used the goals stay the same and that's to minimize the inflammation that occurs from surgery restore motion of the knee restore strength in the quadriceps hamstrings in the hips and the core uh enhance proprioception since the uh proprioceptive function of the ACL is lost when it's ruptured uh the goal of rehab is to try to restore propri reception of the knee as well as Dynamic stability the ability of the knee to remain stable with uh athletic activities uh and have other structures help protect the anterior cruet itself and ultimately the goal is to return the patient to function and prevent a recurrence of the rupture as well as to uh prevent uh injury to the contralateral anterior cruciate ligament as said this is just a relatively brief overview of uh what should be understood about the anterior cruciate ligament uh whether your intent is to continue on an Orthopedics or to uh enter any other field in which you may see somebody with a knee injury uh certainly if you have any questions please do not hesitate to uh contact me uh By Any Means",

  "Stress Fractures Overview Stress fractures are tiny cracks in a bone",
  "They're caused by repetitive force, often from overuse — such as repeatedly jumping up and down or running long distances",
  "Stress fractures can also develop from normal use of a bone that's weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis",
  "Stress fractures are most common in the weight-bearing bones of the lower leg and foot",
  "Track and field athletes and military recruits who carry heavy packs over long distances are at highest risk, but anyone can sustain a stress fracture",
  "If you start a new exercise program, for example, you might develop stress fractures if you do too much too soon",

  "Arora is an orthopedic consultant and a joint replacement surgeon and cut down he's the chief of orthopedic surgery at Columbia Asia Hospital and director of Gurgaon knee and shoulder clinic he has been trained in the UK for several years and has expertise in knee replacement surgery and treatment of sports injuries welcome to speaking to your team doctor rocks you know to literally start off with you know these are extremely startling figures you know why why do we as a country score so so poorly on ball here well I think osteoporosis is not just a problem that we see in India it's a leading cause of factors all over the world in India we are now seeing it more and more often primary reason is that over the last few decades the lifespan average lifespan of Indians has gone up in earlier time the average lifespan was 50 years maybe 60 years now on an average we are seeing people living in their 70s and 80s and that is when really the osteoporosis strikes more so in women less than men but as we become healthier as we live longer we will see more and more of osteoporosis and thanks to the good news doctor know that you just mentioned that you know women are more affected roster processes than men is it like a genetic thing or why why is it the reason that that and this is very worrying of course agreed the reason women are affected or than men are to a part of it is genetic men generally are bigger with stronger bones and second it is wholly physiologically in women after menopause due to hormonal changes bone mass dives down suddenly and typically in women post their menopause the quality of bone strength the bone density it keeps on decreasing it's a one-way slippery slope so that is why women are most commonly affected and of course we're taking questions but dr",
  "Arora is going to be with us so please write to the question in the comment section we will try and get them on cell one very um you know funny fact about you know calcium in the food we eat a lot of people know that you know iron is found in green veggies but for a lot you know there's a lot of your say as I can put it you know people know it's found in milk but apart from milk what are the other really sources of calcium and how how can we actually actually have more calcium in our diet yeah having said that if you come to think of it milk or milk based products they are the richest source of calcium they are pretty much taken by everybody whether you your dietary preference is a vegetarian or non-vegetarian so and I am talking on any milk product not to make it so it could be yogurt it could be let's see it could be charge it could be cheese it could be paneer so anything which is dairy based has excellent amounts of calcium but apart from milk the other foods which have some amount of calcium would be fruits like oranges dried apricots dried figs kale you know so so there are some other items and similarly non-vegetarian food have some amount of calcium so but for all practical purposes dairy products are the way to go absolutely so dairy products are the way to go and you know apart from food what what really in terms of exercising and you know little two three tips that you can share every that people should do every day for better bone health I think and Jim has a not a not bad bigger role to play probably it is a little overrated what is underrated with regards to bone health is the lack of exercise and I think I'm sure recently there was a big study in Lancet which singled out India as one of the areas where people do not exercise enough and it is the lack of exercise which has a far bigger impact on bone health than lack of calcium in the diet because we do not like calcium in our diet what we lack is exercises and maybe what we lack is vitamin D because vitamin D is critical in absorption of calcium even if you have adequate amounts of calcium in the diet but if you don't have enough vitamin E in the system the catcher is not absorbed but I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize to our listeners that it's the lack of exercise which is the most important culprit of poor bone mass and of course so please write in with your questions people already started receiving questions that you know you mentioned of calcium and Oh sweetie wants to know what are the supplements women in particular you know it you know India is not very open to taking supplements you know we always say that you know we shouldn't take supplements and things like that so what what's up what should you look for when you know you when you're buying a supplement and are there any particular supplements that you recommend is the only time when I would recommend a supplement to somebody is essentially when I worry about vitamin D deficiency I often ask my patients to take calcium through diet having a well-balanced diet finding lots of fruits and vegetables would pretty much cover up for most of the vitamins the only other vitamin which might be deficient in a vegetarian diet could be vitamin b12 so maybe vitamin b12 supplementation can be taken but vitamin D is often found to be low it's not only in India that we are saying people with deficient to the vitamin B even in Western world the vitamin D deficiency is rampant however in western world most of the food products are supplemented by additional vitamin D Nestle will give milk which has vitamin D you know juices will have vitamin D bread would have added vitamin D so most of these companies the consumer products will have added vitamin D so so people are eating vitamin D I have a form of supplement without knowing that they're taking supplement in India that does not has yet become a norm and that is why a population has to take vitamin D on their own you know unlike other body parts like you know you do get to know when your eyes are getting weak or you know when you're putting on weight you'll see the extra flab since we can't see our bones what are the really early warning signs apart from acres and pains or which are which are not very very high I mean you just get a niggling pain your L there you take a painkiller and sleep it off maybe what are really the warning signs that you know are you are suffering from a serious probably what goes to process and how should you really start taking action when when should you really start taking action I think that's an excellent question it's very very apt question to ask the reason why we talk about osteoporosis and it's not this talk you will find a lot of other resources on internet about the problems of osteoporosis the reason is that this is called the silent disease there are no signs and symptoms it just hits you when it hits you when you're older and it leads to fractures with trivial Falls fractures which are serious which will make you debilitated which might often need surgery so the best way to protect you from osteoporosis is to look for it take measures right from an early age and in elderly people when I say elderly I shouldn't use it or mentally I should use it middle-aged so from 50 55 onwards the only way to know about your bone density is to do checks we do test called bone densitometry so through that we can check it but younger people do not need to undergo that test okay only to be of course are taking questions or doctor we of course have a very relevant question now Padma wants to know that you know but the sitting job is that you know all of us to back pain is a very very normal condition so do you have any quick you know things or quick tips that you can share for back pain which is not chronic you know it happens like say once a month or something like that can you can you should you improve your posture or you know there are two three things that you can probably share with us yeah cutting back pain for most of our population younger population who are sitting in the office for long hours is primarily it's not a health issue it's more of an ergonomic issue which means that the way you're sitting posture the type of chair you are sitting on the position of your computer and the height of your table so all these things have a big impact on your back pain neck pain even so ideally speaking you should have a chair which should be high it should have an armrest and you're sitting you should be leaning in n degrees backwards you should have a wrong number support so these are the things that you are you need a purpose place to sit and a proper posture apart from proper posture we even if you have a proper chair if you're sick if you're working non-stop without taking a break for many hours 3-4 hours without a break that could also cause back pain so we recommend outpatients that after every hour they should leave the seat move around stretch their back do a little bit of studying except a couple of minutes nothing more than that just two minutes and then get back to their seat and get back to working again so after a 1012 hours working day it's very difficult to push yourself to a gym or do some sort of exercise would believe you me that is the answer there's no point popping in pills so back then it didn't have a work it'll only give you temporary relief exercises right posture right sitting areas and three couldn't brakes that's the answer for patients you know once you get like you you break a bone or you get a fracture a lot of people are weary of exercise you know they're like inium or a pair to choke IV but we should not so what what do you recommend for those who do suffer from osteoporosis what a kind of exercise it should not do we've spoken about the fact that people should exercise but are they any special you know exercises that people should avoid if this uppermost process well they should regularly - yeah I think I'll probably divide the population into two groups one who are younger who would want to stay away from osteoporosis and second group is the people who are already in the older age group and who have osteoporosis so the kind of exercise would be completely different I think let's start with younger population because India is a young country in so since the illogically when you're growing up the peak bone mass the maximum density of bone happens at the age of from 25 to 30 after that the bone density will not increase we can at best maintain the density so the better bone mass you have when you were 25 30 lesser are the chances that you will develop osteoporosis so prevention of osteoporosis do not start when you are 30 35 or 40 it should start much earlier it should start when you are 20 and you're 14 2015 and the best way to have a peak bone mass which is good enough is to do strenuous exercises running playing jumping you know people going out to the park which most of our kids don't do nowadays unfortunately so that's the critical part strenuous exercise is done in a younger age will protect you from osteoporosis later on in life but it's never too late start even when you are thirty to thirty five exercises will never do any harm working out in the gym running swimming swimming probably doesn't improve bone density that much but other impact exercises you know playing badminton playing tennis playing cricket running jumping skipping so anything which transmits forces through our body will improve the bone mass so that is for young people for elderly and for people who have osteoporosis create by step to do nothing more than go for walks for improving bone density of their legs and hips and to take 1 kg dumbbells in their arms and do simple exercises like we used to do in our school just with 1 kg dumbbell and nothing more than that and of course we also rely on medicines for that age group of course so please write me the questions so we have a very interesting question you know one wants to know that sometimes even children you know say that you know their knees hurting or you know probably their shoulders hurting so have you seen cases in your professional career about children getting osteoporosis and what really can be doing sir parents not us to process if not us processes then like a bone a weak bones and stuff like that what can we really do to prevent our children you said you know they need to go out so if you could just uh you know throw some light on that so I you correctly said children never get osteoporosis we never make a diagnosis of osteoporosis in children usually children are not the common attendees in a orthopedic clinic but once in a while we do see children with pains here and there reasons could be where it usually it's a muscular pull sometimes it's a growth related pain sometimes it's a little bit more serious we always take it extremely seriously if a child is complaining of repetitive pain in the same area because children will never complain of pain even even if they have failed will be more interested to go out and play around I tell them mom ok I don't want to go out and play because my bees or they would rather go out and play and not tell their parents so usually if a child is sitting in your clinic complaining of pain in the knee or pain in the joint we shouldn't take it lightly we have to take a great detail of you know care to figure out why it's paining it's not a stupor of second can you say yeah ok decide it now wants to know what is the easiest so Delta G for anything so what what can she do for walking or I think she's asking two specific exercises that she she can do so the knee pain is not a problem it system oh okay so knee pain is a symptom reason could be thousands so one has to figure out why somebody's getting knee pain is it arthritis in the knee which is one of the commonest sources of champagne or is it due to some muscular imbalance which is also fairly common or if it's um sports injuries like a tear in the ligament or the meniscus sometimes pain from the hip can get referred to the knee so again people who have recurrent knee pain younger or old they need to see the doctor we have to figure out why we pain is happening and then treat it accordingly there is no simple remedy for these and you know correlation to that toe we had a question earlier you know should be all set it's a very interesting question to ask that you know a knee replacement surgeries in particular it's it's gone up in the last 10 years ah of course it has to do a lot with a sedentary lifestyle so what would you have to say about that and what shift do you see in terms of you know people actually going out of the way to better their bone health yeah so again I think knee replacement or the incidence of knee arthritis has not do it's not related to both health that much it is again related to lifespan in India we are seeing more and more patients who need knee replacement every year for thus 10 years but this trend has been happening in Western countries for more than 50 years so if we maybe 10 20 years ago if we were doing one knee replacement in India Western countries are doing 20 million replacements reason mean that in an average western country you know Europe or Australia or us the lifespan is around 80 85 so by that age everybody's knees and hips both they get damaged and once they get damaged people get pain and those people eventually then end up with a replacement surgery now that trend has started in India because we see our population living longer we very frequently see people in their 75 and 80 if I even this is the time and people start to get paid yes but at the same time we do see a fair amount of people in their younger age groups 50 then early 60s who also have significant knee arthritis I think part of the problem is due to weak bones part of the problem is due to weight sometimes it is the rate which is causing the problem so it's not just bone health it's more than that but yes trend of knee arthritis is on us it will see more and more in the kind times to come and knee replacement is one of the best solutions and a time-tested solution it has been done for more than 50 years to create this condition absolutely and we don't have much time left so please try to do the questions doctor you mentioned exercises as part of your daily dream or Shivani wants to know do you recommend yoga you know as part of you know your bone building and one of the forms of exercise you personally believe in it and do recommend it to even probably or patients or generally to friends or yourself do it is an excellent way of keeping your body supple maintaining a good core muscle strength which is so important for your back pain prevention neck pain prevention and it improves the mobility of the joint so yes yoga is an excellent way of keeping your bones and joints supple and healthy and I absolutely recommend it to my patients okay create Oh dr",
  "sandy wants to know that she suffers from - Sir Michael um and you know she does exercises at home and you know she she's she feels better after these exercises what she wants to know is it ok to continue like that if you know if she regularly does exercises at home and not take any medication or go to the doctor I think she might have consulted a doctor before she's not really clearly mentioned that so for survival normal regular home exercises are ok I mean she says so head start spinning once in a while and you know she does exercises and she's fine then so for that so again it's a very very common presentation that we see I won't say that ok ignore all neck pain so I think so terms are Michael is used Loosli every neck pain is often referred to as cervical which is not true cervical means cervical spondylosis spondylosis which is a medical term this condition is essentially seen in people in the Middle Ages 45s and fifties and sixties and it is due to wear and tear changes but it doesn't it's not seen in people in their 30s and 20s and often everybody in their younger days who get neck pain they call it a survivor which is a misnomer is so much having said that the problem in younger people is usually not always it is usually because of muscular issues I should call it tech neck rather than a cervical all of us are spending time looking at the phone strings and it's a technology induced neck pain that is the commonest source of pain in today's time so yes exercises will help but apart from exercise is improving your neck poster avoiding looking at phone screens for too long and you know maybe some of your viewers are looking at you know it's more for observation a lot of people as you mentioned you know some time back you know conversation that you know the pop of pink you know so you know if you can just throw some light of self-medication and how harmful really it is and people should not do that yeah popping paint is the worst thing that somebody can do themselves if they do it without a very very good reason because painkillers only suppress the pain and eventually in the long term you you know they will have some form of side effect either we'll get used to it you will become addicted to certain types of painkillers they can give you acidity they can give you ulcers and at worst they can damage the kidneys and people need the dialysis so if if you're really worried if you really want to know how bad things can be take one day out go to any hospital visit the renal department talk to the people people who are on dialysis all of them have been on painkillers at some point in the majority of them and they end up getting the others throughout so there is no replacement for kidneys we can change the knees but we can't change the kidneys so don't pop and painkillers don't do it yourself I think we have just time to take off you know one last question doctor you know we say as we age of course you know we are metabolism slows down and things like that so it's it's um you know I'm not saying that everyone can get osteoporosis but is if I know it doesn't really happen at at a certain age is it unavoidable or you mention of course exercise really helps but are there any more you're not tips that you can give to prevent or you're maybe after 60 as I said of course you know you're not you biological clock is ticking so obviously like you get your eyes your bones will also get me but are any tips a final tips that you can share maybe for youngsters that you know may be late teens or early 20s that you know really start doing this yeah I think as I mentioned earlier to prevent osteoporosis things have to start at a much younger age broadly speaking to prevent osteoporosis it's a combination of regular exercises good amount of calcium maintaining good amount levels of vitamin D and when we are older checking your bone density because it is it has pump it is down to go down of course and once it is going down we can stem it by using medicines so there are medicines for osteoporosis if you're extremely affected it is just that people don't feel any symptoms from osteoporosis they never get it checked and they only find it out when they sustained a fracture from it so getting regular health check-ups done in the older age group and taking appropriate treatment for it so that's the overall treatment for osteoporosis okay great I think that's the time we have today thank you dr",
  "Laura thank you so much for joining us it's been a lovely session I think the audience the viewers of watching this will take a lot of tips from you thank you so much if you want to say some last words about the session about yourself I mean feel free it's wonderful session that we have discussed about a lot of common problems and I you know wish your listeners all the best and never lead a happy life and healthy life thank you and this is all we have for today we will be coming back soon for another Facebook live session for your daily dose of spirituality please keep logging into speaking",
  "Treatment of Unusual occurrence of Thoracic Pedunculated Osteochondroma Abstract: The purpose of this case report is to describe the unusual occurrence of a child’s thoracic pedunculated osteochondroma, which originates from the fourth thoracic vertebra’s lamina",
  "Characteristics of the disease: A 7-year-old girl was referred for a back swelling assessment",
  "The patient has been experiencing painless, gradual, atraumatic back swelling for about two years",
  "Physical examination revealed a healthy youngster with a well-defined mass around the midline of the upper thoracic spine, measuring around 46 cm",
  "There were no discernible clinical indications of inherited multiple exostoses",
  "Computerized tomography and plain radiography suggested the presence of a pedunculated osteochondroma originating from the fourth thoracic vertebra’s lamina",
  "Intervention and result: The mass was surgically removed from the patient",
  "The diagnosis was validated by the pathologist",
  "After two years of follow-up, there was no sign of a radiological or clinical recurrence",
  "Conclusion: This report details a unique instance of a solitary pedunculated osteochondroma in a child under 10 years old that arises from the lamina of the fourth thoracic vertebra and how it was managed",
  "Keywords: benign tumors, hereditary multiple exostoses, spine column tumors, thoracic vertebra INTRODUCTION: The most frequent benign bone and cartilage tumor is osteochondroma, which typically affects the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humorous",
  "It prefers to occur during the metaphysis of long bones.3",
  "Osteochondromas account for 8%–9% of all bone tumors and around 35%–40% of all primary benign bone tumours.36 Many of these tumors have no symptoms and could go undetected",
  "As a result, the incidence is most likely higher than stated.3,7 About 85% of cases of osteochondromas begin as single lesions",
  "The remaining ones are a result of hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant condition marked by the development of several benign growths of bone covered in cartilage.1,8 Osteochondromas can develop from any zone of endochondral bone in the context of a dysplastic disease.4 The origin of these bony growths is believed to be a laterally displaced portion of the epiphyseal cartilage, which leads to dysplastic growth instead of gradual endochondral ossification.9",
  "Osteochondromas often start growing in early childhood and stop when the epiphyses close during puberty.10 10% of solitary osteochondromas and 1% of solitary osteochondromas may malignantly develop into chondrosarcoma",
  "If the osteochondroma becomes painful, if it grows after skeletal growth stops, or if the thickness of the cartilaginous cap is more than 2 cm in adults or 3 cm in children, malignant transformation should be ruled out.1.12 The thickness of the cap can be measured with computerized tomography (CT), ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although the most precise technique is MRI scanning.1, 6, 12 Lesions that are asymptomatic can be monitored without medical intervention, whereas those that are symptomatic require surgical excision.1",
  "Pain, deformity, cosmesis, ongoing development, probable malignant change, and neurovascular impairment are among the indications for excision of a solitary osteochondroma.2, 3, 12, and 14 Osteochondromas come in two distinct forms: sessile and pedunculated",
  "The slender pedicle of the pedunculated kind is oriented away from the growth plate",
  "The broad based ones are sessile",
  "Just 1%–4% of all osteochondromas are single bone tumors that start in the spine.3, 10, 15, and 18 Usually, they affect the cervical spine, namely the C1 and C2 vertebrae.10, 19, 20 The lumbar and thoracic spines are the next most commonly affected regions",
  "In this report, we present a single pedunculated osteochondroma that is asymptomatic",
  "emerging in a 7-year-old child from the lamina of the fourth thoracic (T4) vertebra",
  "While a sizable number of osteochondroma cases have been documented in the literature, very few cases involving spine osteochondromas have been described in patients under the age of ten",
  "Since many of the reported instances did not specify the kind of osteochondroma, it was impossible to determine the precise number of osteochondromas in the pedunculated spine",
  "Case Report: The orthopedic clinic was consulted for the assessment of a painless swelling in the girl’s back, age 7",
  "The patient stated that the edema had been there for around two years and was gradually getting worse",
  "There was no past medical history of trauma, fever, or nocturnal agony",
  "Her family was worried about her outward look, potential psychological impact, and sometimes back pain when she slept",
  "A physical examination revealed a youngster in good condition with a well-defined mass at the upper thoracic spine area, measuring 4 - 6 cm around the midline",
  "There were no indications of a spinal deformity, and the mass was fixed, bone firm, contender, deep to the skin and fascia, and no adhered to the skin",
  "There were no other palpable lumps, and there was no clinical indication of HME",
  "The entire neurovascular assessment and the remainder of the physical examination were both normal",
  "In addition to zones of endochondral mineralization in the marrow underneath the osteochondroma, plain radiographs and a CT scan revealed a protrusion of cortical and medullary bone relative to the cortical bone of the spinous process of the T4 vertebra",
  "The bone marrow of the nearby bone was in close proximity to the medullary section of the pedunculated osteochondroma",
  "Following a discussion with the parents regarding the available treatment choices, surgical excision was selected, and informed consent was acquired",
  "A posterior midline incision was used to approach the tumor, which was then entirely excised, including the cartilaginous cap, without causing any damage to the T4 vertebra’s lamina or spinous process",
  "the lamina, interspinous ligament, spinous process, or supraspinous ligament",
  "Pathologically, as shown in Figure 4, the lesion was composed of several irregularly shaped dome-shaped structures with a vague capsule and a hyaline cartilage cap measuring 3 mm that was continuous with bony trabeculae",
  "The cartilage cap features were consistent with osteochondroma, and the bony stalk contained elements of normal marrow",
  "A two-year follow up revealed no evidence of a radiological or clinical recurrence",
  "Discussion: Osteochondromas primarily affect the long bones; it is uncommon for them to originate in the vertebral column (1%– 4% of cases),4,21, 22",
  "With or without protrusion into the spinal canal, the most common location of vertebral osteochondromas is in an eccentric position inside the neural arch.23 It is rare for an osteochondroma to extend intraspinally",
  "As a result, affected individuals hardly ever exhibit neurological symptoms.24 Depending on the size of the lesion, a decompression laminectomy or hemi laminectomy is the most common surgical treatment for spinal column osteochondromas, which typically originate dorsally or dorasolaterally.25 Development in tandem with HME is more typical and has been covered in detail in earlier articles.21, 26, and 28 For a single osteochondroma, the typical age of clinical manifestation, encompassing all spinal levels, is approximately 30 years and HME for twenty years.28 It is still unclear what causes solitary osteochondroma and HME pathogenesis",
  "Despite making up 40% of the vertebrae, the thoracic spine was the location of only 26%–28% of all spinal osteochondromas in the reviews of osteochondroma published by Albrecht et al.10 and Roblot et al.11",
  "Clinical symptoms associated with osteochondromas typically appear during growing in the second or third decade of life",
  "Roblot et al",
  "reported four occurrences of spinal solitary osteochondroma in children under the age of ten, all of which were in the cervical spine and all of which were in males",
  "They also reported one case of HME in children under the age of ten, which was also in the cervical spine",
  "Brastianos et al.’s review articles on isolated thoracic osteochondromas",
  "Only one case under the age of ten was recorded by Roblot et al",
  "and Khosla et al",
  "It was inextricably linked to the lamina (presumably sessile).2, 11, 19, These articles did not specify the type of osteochondroma",
  "One case of a massive cervical pedunculated osteochondroma of the cervical spine in an 8-year-old child with HME was reported by Rao and Jakheria.29 The tumor in this case, which affected a 7-year-old child, originated from the posterior part of the T4 vertebra",
  "This makes it an unusual case",
  "The patient’s psychological state was enhanced and her symptoms were fully resolved through surgery without compromising the spine’s essential anatomical integrity",
  "Conclusion: In summary, distinguishing between a sessile and pedunculated osteochondroma in the spine is crucial due to the sessile type’s inseparability, the need for partial lamina and spinous process removal for full tumor excision, and the increased risk of neurological complications",
  "The posterior spinal element is not harmed in the separable and en bloc excision of the pedunculated kind",
  "How to do hip arthroplasty Abstract: Background: Acetabulum fractures can cause posttraumatic arthritis even after they have been fixed, making them a complex and challenging condition to manage",
  "In this patient group, total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been the most often done operation for posttraumatic arthritis problems",
  "The purpose of this research is to evaluate the complications and functional outcomes of converting to total hip arthroscopy (THA) for posttraumatic arthritis following acetabular fracture",
  "Patients and techniques: A mean follow-up period of 3.7 years (range: 2–5 years) was observed for 49 patients",
  "Four occurrences of sciatic nerve palsy were among the complications; all of them had suffered trauma during the first procedure",
  "Two instances had two stages of surgery due to infection, which was indicated by elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate",
  "Following THA infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, one case was treated using a one-stage infection strategy based on protein and frozen section samples that were supplied intraoperatively with a 10 neutrophil/high-power field",
  "We employed cages in two cases, the Girdle stone surgery for severe infections and uncontrolled diabetes, and uncommented cups in 47 cases",
  "Findings: At the last follow-up, the modified Hip Harris Score mean improved from 47 (31–66) before to the revision to 89 (79–95)",
  "At the final follow-up, the average pain component for both Western Ontario and McMaster Universities increased from 7–20 to 0–11",
  "Absence of dislocation, pulmonary thromboembolism or deep vein thrombosis, fresh nerve damage, and heterotopic ossification",
  "In conclusion, reasonable pain reduction and functional improvement can result from the conversion to THA following posttraumatic arthritis in acetabular fracture patients",
  "Keywords: acetabular fracture, conversion total hip arthroplasty, posttraumatic arthritis, internal fixation",
  "Introduction: Complex acetabular fracture has not been clearly explored in the literature",
  "Its utility was limited to associated fracture patterns based on the Letournel classification by some authors",
  "However, others have used it for various types of fractures, including processions of the acetabulum",
  "Patterns like this are more demanding in management and utilization.1 Acetabular fractures are challenging and difficult to manage",
  "They can result in posttraumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis of femoral head, or both",
  "Despite the fact that open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) reduces the risk of posttrau- matic arthritis, the risk cannot be completely eliminated.2 Furthermore, ORIF failure in fracture of acetabulum ranges between 12% and 57% in different investigations",
  "In case of posttraumatic arthritis and its adverse effects, total hip arthroplasty (THA) might be a feasible resolving proce- dure.7 The conversion of acetabular fracture to arthroplasty leads to different survival rates",
  "Regarding the frequency of acetabular fracture in the elderly, it can be predicted that number of patients in this age group undergoing THA will increase.1,3,4,8–10 Post-acetabular fracture THA poses different challenges for orthopedic surgeons, including residual pelvis deformities, bone loss in the acetabulum, infections, osteonecrosis, heterotopic ossification, maintained metalwork, sciatic nerve palsy, and other problems encountered in acetabular element fixations in the long term.8 Indication for performing an acute THA in young people with concurrent femoral head and acetabular difficulties is severe non reconstruct able comminution, and in geriatric patients, the indication is severe bony comminution",
  "Outcomes of THA for posttraumatic acetabular fracture consist of good pain relief and functional developments.10,11 In a large-scale population meta-analysis, 3,670 acetabular fractures were included and the most common long-term postsurgical ORIF complication was posttraumatic arthritis (20%)",
  "The rate of osteonecrosis of femoral head was 5.6%.12 In other investigations, the incidence of posttraumatic arthritis was between 10% and 60% in some series",
  "The incidence of femoral head osteonecrosis was between 3% and 53%.13 In one study, the incidence of conversion of ORIF to THA during and after 5 years of first treatment was 11%.14 Fractures of acetabulum might grow the risk of post- traumatic degenerative arthritis and THA",
  "Previous investigations revealed that adverse events related to conversion of ORIF to THA are higher in comparison with primary THA.15 Predisposing factors in conversion arthroplasty failure are comminution and initial displacement, femoral head defect, fracture of femoral head or neck, and crush in anterolateral or posterior portion of acetabulum",
  "It is suggested to perform THA immediately when patients encounter these situations after ORIF.16,17 The problems associated with performing converted THA such patients are poor bone supply, damaged tissue, higher risk of infection, and presence of previous implant.8 In the current study, the researchers assessed short-term functional outcomes and the associated complications in posttraumatic arthritis patients who had undergone THA after ORIF",
  "Patients and Methods: This study examined the outcomes of patients at Tehran, Iran’s Erfan and Milad hospitals who were eligible for conversion from posttraumatic arthritis to THA by observational prospective analysis",
  "When they were injured, the age range of the participants was 17 to 68 years old, with 43 males and 6 females",
  "Between 1998 and 2015, all patients underwent surgery to convert their posttraumatic arthritis from internal fixation of an acetabular fracture to total hip arthroscopy (THA)",
  "It is noteworthy to emphasize that the conversion of THA is frequently required due to the factors associated with the failure of fixation following posttraumatic arthritis",
  "Following a consistent methodology, all patients who met the criteria for conversion surgery underwent an investigation lasting between 3.2 and 17.1 years on average",
  "Posttraumatic arthritis followed acetabular fracture in all patients",
  "fracture and required THA as a result of excruciating pain, stiffness, and restricted mobility",
  "Every attempt was made to achieve a safe and specific distance from the prior incision",
  "All procedures were performed utilizing a direct lateral (Hardinge) approach with the patient in the lateral position and a standard-length incision",
  "Under general anesthesia, patients had surgery using a standard protocol with some slight modifications",
  "A plane was created at a distance of 1-2 cm on either side between the subcutaneous tissues and the gluteal fascia, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues were incised in a single line",
  "After dividing the gluteus medius and minimums, a capsulotomy was carried out",
  "The plates were left in place during THA, and the only screws in the joints or were removed or taken out by a milling tool on the reamer path",
  "After the posttraumatic arthritis issues developed, this was not the first operation",
  "Thus, it is indisputable that press-fitting from the cup and reaming the acetabulum require a significant level of accuracy",
  "If there was a possibility of infection or if the acetabular implants were becoming loose or affected, the researchers removed them",
  "Osteotomies were used in certain instances to remove the plates",
  "Throughout the patient evaluation, every other procedure was carried out in compliance with the established guidelines.18 The Girdle stone surgery was utilized in 1 case by the researchers to treat severe infections and uncontrolled diabetes; cages were used in 2 cases, and uncommented cups were used in 47 cases",
  "The metal bearing surface was extremely cross-linked polyethylene, with the exception of five juvenile cases where the senior author combined highly cross-linked polyethylene with third-generation delta ceramic",
  "It is important to note that X-rays were taken of each patient during the procedure, and that after it was finished, an abduction pillow was placed between the legs",
  "Additionally, prophylactic antibiotics were started in the operating room 30 minutes before to the incision and repeated twice more",
  "Intravenous transfusion of 15 mg/ kg tranexamic acid was used to reduce bleeding during the procedure",
  "All patients also received enoxaparin for a month as a prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and indomethacin-SR 75 mg was administered daily for 6 weeks to treat heterotopic ossification.18 Examining data statistically: Utilizing descriptive statistical methods, the mean SD of quantitative",
  "The variables before and after the procedure were compared using a paired t-test, and the results were assessed using a linear regression test",
  "The software SPSS (19.0 for Windows; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all analyses",
  "P-values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant",
  "Declaration of Ethics: The Islamic Azad University of Medical Sciences, Tehran branch’s ethical committee oversaw all ethical concerns pertaining to patient information and procedures, and ethical statements were authorized by the committee",
  "In compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, each patient was required to fill out a written informed consent form before they could take part in the study",
  "Outcomes: For each participant, a clinical and radiological evaluation was conducted following the conversion process",
  "Prior to the operation, the modified Hip Harris Score (MHHS) was recorded",
  "six months following the procedure and at the two-year follow-up",
  "In the current study, none of the patients experienced dislocation, DVT or pulmonary thromboembolism, heterotopic ossification, new nerve injury (only in 4 cases of preoperative sciatic nerve injury, tendon transfer was performed 6 months postoperatively), or new nerve injury",
  "Two patients required reoperation: one was an acute infection that was managed with a one-stage revision, and the other involved a serious infection and sepsis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and an advanced age of the patient that Girdle stone addressed",
  "Radiographic Assessment: After internal fixation, all subjects received THA for posttraumatic arthritis, with an average follow-up period of 6.2 years (ranging from 3.2 to 17.1 years)",
  "Simple and complicated fractures are the two types of fractures that are typically seen in acetabular fractures",
  "The majority of patients received plate treatment initially for complicated fractures",
  "Between three and seventeen years following the first treatment, all of them experienced posttraumatic arthritis following ORIF and required total hip arthroplasty (THA) as a result of complications from their previous acetabula fracture procedure",
  "Difficulties: Four occurrences of sciatic nerve palsy were among the complications; all of them had suffered trauma during the first procedure",
  "Due to infection, which was indicated by high levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein as well as by frozen section samples (confirmed by >10 polymorph nuclear cells/high-power field), two cases underwent two stages of surgery; one patient developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after THA.followup after surgery Six months after the conversion surgery, the MHHS was used to assess its effects on pain relief and practical progress, even though it had been recorded for every patient during the 2-year final follow-up",
  "The results showed that, six months after THA, the MHHS had improved from 47 (31–66) prior to the procedure to 89 (79–95)",
  "Furthermore, at the last follow-up, the average pain score for McMaster and Western Ontario Universities decreased from 15 (7–20) to 4 (0–11)",
  "Four patients from the current study that were treated are shown in Figures 1-4",
  "Discussion: Fractures of the proximal side of the femur are increasing in frequency as the population ages.19 Additionally, THA is the most advantageous technique in orthopedics and one of the greatest practices in modern orthopedic surgery",
  "The procedures are carried out for various reasons, and the indications for post-traumatic arthritis are the same as those for any patient with a destructed hip disorder",
  "These include unbearable pain, trouble performing daily tasks, confirmed radiological signs of advanced arthritis, articular incongruity, or osteonecrosis.18 Whether simple or complex, the ORIF approach is used to treat the majority of acetabulum fractures",
  "Orthopedic doctors use THA when patients have difficulties associated to post-traumatic arthritis in order to get the desired results",
  "A precise reoperation is a crucial component that might enhance the likelihood of surgical success",
  "However, it’s also necessary to carry out a surgery in a proper and conventional manner: The primary focus of many investigations was THA of acetabular fractures following unsuccessful internal fixation",
  "32 patients receiving THA after a failed dynamic hip screw were evaluated by Hamad et al",
  "in 2023",
  "fixation and discovered just one dislocation and one per prosthetic fracture",
  "At the end follow-up, 78% of patients had good–excellent clinical results.23 The rate of osteoporotic fractures, such as those of the pelvis and acetabulum, will rise as the population ages",
  "Compared to younger cases with similar injuries, management of senior patients with acetabular fractures is more debatable",
  "In these cases, prevention of posttraumatic arthritis and THA is still the best way to reduce the need for revision arthroplasty",
  "In the elderly population, arthroplasty is frequently used to treat proximal femur fractures and is However, most surgeons who perform acute total hip arthroplasty (THA) for older acetabular fractures do not permit immediate weight bearing following surgery",
  "As such, the debate over the most effective way to treat these difficult fractures continues",
  "Four therapy options have been identified so far: ORIF, restricted open reduction and percutaneous screw fixation, acute THA, and non-surgical treatment with early mobilization",
  "However, the precise indications and advantages of any treatment are still unknown",
  "The development of cement less fixation and implant designs has significantly improved clinical outcomes, especially on the acetabular side.24, 25 The current investigation had certain shortcomings",
  "The sample size was minimal during the study period and the study did not include a specific age group for analysis",
  "Conclusion: The current study’s findings, taken together with a slightly higher rate of intraoperative complications, indicate that the conversion of posttraumatic arthritis following acetabular internal fixation to total hip artharthoplasty (THA) is a safe option that yields good functional results and is clinically successful without increasing the risk of complications",
  "On the other hand, it is imperative to alert patients to the risk of only partial postoperative relief from groin pain",
  "Appropriate preoperative planning is likely to increase patient satisfaction and decrease discomfort, and raising awareness of common complications may enhance results",
  "A large-scale study involving age-diverse subgroups is advised in order to improve the validity and generalizability of the findings",
  "Hip osteoarthritis Hip osteoarthritis is a condition that many people have heard of but often do not fully understand",
  "It is a problem that affects the joints in your hips, causing pain and stiffness",
  "While it is commonly seen in older adults, it can actually affect people of all ages",
  "Let’s explore what hip osteoarthritis is, why it happens, and what symptoms to look out for",
  "Causes of Hip Osteoarthritis Hip osteoarthritis develops when the hip cartilage tissues wear down over time",
  "Several factors can contribute to the development of hip osteoarthritis, and understanding these causes is essential for effective prevention and management",
  "Let us explore the primary causes in more detail: Age-Related Wear and Tear One of the most common causes of hip osteoarthritis is the natural aging process",
  "As we age, the cartilage cushions the hip joint may gradually wear down",
  "This age-related wear and tear can lead to the development of osteoarthritis",
  "It is important to note that while aging is a significant risk factor, hip osteoarthritis can occur at any age",
  "Genetic Factors Genetics can play a role in the development of hip osteoarthritis",
  "If you have a family history of osteoarthritis, you may be genetically predisposed to the condition",
  "Certain genetic traits can affect the structure and stability of your joints, increasing the likelihood of osteoarthritis development",
  "Obesity and Lifestyle Factors Carrying excess weight places additional stress on the hip joints",
  "The more weight the hips have to support, the greater the risk of developing osteoarthritis",
  "Additionally, a sedentary lifestyle with limited physical activity can contribute to muscle weakness and joint stiffness, further increasing the risk",
  "Injuries and Joint Damage Past injuries or trauma to the hip joint can increase the risk of hip osteoarthritis, even if the injury occurred years ago",
  "Fractures, dislocations, or other joint injuries may: Lead to long-term damage and joint instability Contribute to the development of osteoarthritis Overuse and Repetitive Motion Engaging in activities or occupations that involve repetitive hip movements can lead to overuse and strain on the joint",
  "Athletes or individuals with physically demanding jobs may be at a higher risk of hip osteoarthritis due to the constant stress placed on the hip joint",
  "Congenital Abnormalities In some cases, congenital abnormalities or structural issues present from birth can predispose individuals to hip osteoarthritis",
  "These abnormalities can affect the alignment and stability of the hip joint, leading to increased wear and tear over time",
  "Understanding these causes allows individuals to take proactive steps, such as: Maintaining a healthy weight Staying physically active Seeking medical attention for injuries Early intervention and lifestyle adjustments can make a significant difference in managing this condition effectively",
  "Symptoms of Hip Osteoarthritis Hip osteoarthritis typically begins with subtle warning signs that may be easy to dismiss",
  "Early symptoms often include: Stiffness: You may notice stiffness in your hip joint, especially in the morning or after prolonged periods of inactivity",
  "Discomfort: A mild, nagging discomfort in the hip region is common",
  "It might feel like a dull ache",
  "Reduced Range of Motion: You may find it slightly harder to move your hip as freely as before, particularly when trying to rotate or flex",
  "Progression of Symptoms As hip osteoarthritis progresses, these initial warning signs can intensify",
  "You may experience: Pain: The discomfort can evolve into more pronounced pain",
  "This pain might interfere with your daily activities and sleep",
  "Limping: To alleviate pain, you might start to favor one leg over the other, resulting in a noticeable limp",
  "Crepitus: You could hear or feel a grinding or popping sensation in the hip joint when moving",
  "Loss of Flexibility: The range of motion in your hip may become significantly restricted, making simple tasks challenging",
  "Impact on Daily Life The impact of hip osteoarthritis on daily life can be substantial",
  "Chronic pain and reduced mobility can affect your ability to perform everyday activities, such as: Walking: You may find it painful to take even short walks",
  "Climbing Stairs: Going up and down stairs can become a challenging task",
  "Sitting and Standing: Transitions between sitting and standing can be uncomfortable",
  "It is important to recognize these symptoms early on and seek medical attention to prevent the condition from worsening",
  "Understanding these signs can help individuals take proactive steps toward managing hip osteoarthritis effectively",
  "The knee is the biggest joint in the body",
  "Its main function is to absorb and support most of the body’s weight as you move and perform various physical activities",
  "The knee joint is also the most susceptible to injury and dysfunction, making it crucial to prioritize its care and maintenance",
  "In managing sudden or chronic knee pain, proper weight management is essential",
  "Excess weight increases the risk of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis",
  "This health risk can lead to more severe and chronic conditions that affect your quality of life over time",
  "Here’s everything you need to know about the connection between knee pain and weight management and what steps you can take to manage your weight",
  "The Connection Between Knee Pain and Weight Knee pain can be traced back to sports injuries and overuse issues",
  "Among these causes is osteoarthritis, or cartilage degeneration between the bones",
  "Arthritis is a common joint condition affecting any part of the body, including the knee",
  "It can also happen at any age",
  "Arthritis is a prevalent condition that affects over 50 million adults and 300,000 children in the US",
  "Obesity, on the other hand, is also not a new problem in the US",
  "In fact, according to the CDC, over 73.6% of adults over 20 in a recent survey were overweight, including those who had obesity",
  "Excessive body fat can negatively impact your overall body’s systems – including your joint health",
  "Obesity is also among the major risks for developing osteoarthritis",
  "Due to obesity, the knee joint carries more weight to support the body",
  "However, the more weight on your joint, the more likely it is to cause wear and tear on the cartilage",
  "This often leads to aching and swollen knee joints, eventually leading to knee pain",
  "Many studies have found that weight and knee pain are related factors",
  "One study even found that people who have obesity are four to five times more likely to get knee arthritis",
  "However, taking control of your weight can mitigate the symptoms of knee arthritis, including knee pain",
  "According to another recent study, losing just 10 pounds halts knee arthritis development by 50%",
  "Losing weight can reduce knee pain and other symptoms of joint disorders by decreasing stress placed on the joint",
  "Solutions for Managing Knee Pain and Weight While losing weight can be a difficult task and an overwhelming lifestyle change, one of its benefits includes managing your knee pain and stopping it from worsening",
  "There are many exercises and physical therapy options to manage knee pain and reduce weight",
  "Low-impact exercises such as swimming and cycling for a period every week can be beneficial in reducing knee pain",
  "A physical therapist can guide you through flexibility and mobility exercises to take the pressure off your knee joint and reduce knee pain",
  "Maintaining a healthy weight goes hand in hand with maintaining a healthy lifestyle",
  "Evaluating your diet and seeking your healthcare provider for specific dietary recommendations based on your current health status can help manage weight",
  "Medication to manage weight is also used along with other treatments",
  "A discussion with your healthcare provider can help you find the right medication for your case",
  "Cognitive behavioral therapy can also support your weight management plan by managing your stress and helping you have a positive outlook during your weight loss journey",
  "It’s essential to remember that every step towards weight management counts, no matter how small they are",
  "While weight management journeys can take a long time, their effects can greatly reduce the risk of developing knee pain and improve your overall health",
  "What is a Kyphoplasty & How Can It Help Me? A minimally invasive spine procedure that is being performed with increased frequency across the orthopedic community is kyphoplasty",
  "This procedure is meant solely for those who have a compression fracture in one or more vertebrae in the spine",
  "With the help of a balloon, the act of relieving chronic back pain due to a vertebral compression fracture has revolutionized",
  "What is a vertebral fracture? It is important to know that the spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae",
  "A vertebral compression fracture is a result of a break or crack in one of these bones",
  "Typically, this happens to vertebrae that have degenerated over time due to aging and the deterioration of the vertebrae",
  "A vertebral compression fracture can also be the result of an accident, such as a car crash",
  "There are more than 700,000 vertebral compression fractures a year in America, so it is important to see a physician for a prompt diagnosis",
  "What are the symptoms of a compression fracture? Sudden and severe pain in your back Limited spinal movement Increased pain while walking Decreased pain when laying down Loss of height Deformity (kyphosis, or round back) What is a Kyphoplasty Procedure? Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that can treat a vertebral compression fracture",
  "When a kyphoplasty is performed, the surgeon utilizes a continuous live x-ray called fluoroscopy",
  "This creates a live visualization of the placement of instruments since the incision is so small",
  "A small needle is then guided into the fractured vertebrae where the surgeon then inflates a small balloon",
  "The balloon restores height to the collapsed vertebra",
  "The cavity that the balloon created is then filled with surgical cement that will immediately stabilize the bone",
  "The incisions are so small that stitches aren’t even required, just a bandage",
  "Who is eligible for Kyphoplasty? Kyphoplasty is one of many treatments available for vertebral compression fractures, however, it is the only minimally invasive option",
  "Kyphoplasty is not meant for back pain that is not caused by a vertebral compression fracture",
  "Typically, these are what make an ideal kyphoplasty candidate: Increased back pain due to compression fracture Reduced ability to move and function because of the fracture Pain is related to the fracture and no other problems The Center for Bone & Joint Surgery is proud to offer state-of-the-art orthopedic care",
  "With a team of highly trained orthopedic surgeons, each with their own specific areas of expertise, there is a physician perfectly tailored for you and your pain",
  "If you are experiencing orthopedic or spine pain, contact the Center for Bone & Joint Surgery at 561.798.6600",

  "What Is Spinal Cord Injury and Its Treatment? This article explores spinal cord injury and treatment options in detail",
  "Health related to the spine and spinal cord is the foundation of an active, happy and peaceful life",
  "Thus, knowing about spinal cord injuries and treatment options will definitely enrich life in multiple ways",
  "The Spine & The Spinal Cord The spine is the most crucial part of the human body",
  "It helps keep us upright",
  "Without it, no human being would be able to sit and stand straight",
  "Apart from this ability, the spine also protects the spinal cord",
  "Talking about its anatomical structure, the spine is a column of small bones called vertebrae",
  "This column is hollow inside, a long near-vertical cavity, which is also known as a spinal cavity",
  "Inside this cavity is the spinal cord, enclosed and suspended in spinal fluid",
  "The spinal cord is a cylindrical bundle of nerve tissues",
  "This cord plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the brain and the rest of the body",
  "The brain and the spinal cord both together are named the central nervous system",
  "An injury to this critical cord is called a spinal cord injury, which can lead to devastating health complications without prompt medical attention",
  "The causes of injury are discussed below",
  "Causes The spinal cord can get injured due to traumatic or non-traumatic causes",
  "A traumatic cause means harmful external force, for example, intense blows, accidents, falls, hits, violence etc",
  "For non-traumatic causes, they happen internally and injure the spinal cord, for example, tumors, infections, inflammation, arthritis, disc degeneration etc",
  "Furthermore, a spinal cord injury can also be categorized as either primary or secondary",
  "To understand it better, consider the following scenario",
  "As people age, the water content in a spinal disc reduces and thus it shrinks in size",
  "In other words, aging dehydrates a spinal disc",
  "A dehydrated disc becomes more prone to herniation or damage",
  "If a disc becomes herniated, it impinges on the nearby nerve roots, which can injure the spinal cord",
  "If the treatment isn’t provided on time, it can lead to permanent disabilities",
  "This is an example of a secondary spinal cord injury as a complication of the herniated disc",
  "Primary injuries in the spinal cord often occur due to a traumatic cause",
  "Symptoms Symptoms or how a spinal cord injury affects you depends on the location and severity",
  "These are two crucial aspects to consider in every spinal cord injury",
  "Location: The spinal cord runs from the head to the bottom of the waist in the spinal cavity",
  "However, this is just a simple view",
  "In reality, the spinal cord is also branched at each vertebral level",
  "Each vertebra has small cavities on either side—the spinal cord branches out to other parts of the body through these openings (cavities)",
  "The entire spine is categorized into the following major parts, namely Cervical Spine (The Neck Area) Thoracic Spine (Upper-Middle Back) Lumbar Spine (Lower Back) Sacral Spine (The Above Part of Tailbone) There are 7 vertebrae from C1 to C7 in the neck or the cervical spine",
  "Similarly, Thoracic Spine is made up of 12 vertebral units, known as T1 to T12",
  "For Lumbar Spine, there are 5 vertebrae, denoted by L1-L5",
  "Finally, vertebrae in the sacral spine are also 5 in number and are known as S1 to S5",
  "Each vertebra has nerve roots branching out of its side openings to all the body parts",
  "If the spinal cord at the cervical level is damaged, it will affect the rest of the body down the neck or the site of injury",
  "Likewise, if the injury is at the thoracic level, it will affect every part of the body down to the site of injury",
  "Thus, the location is a crucial consideration in spinal cord injury",
  "The site of injury in the spine decides which part of the body will be affected",
  "Severity: Another thing is how bad the injury is",
  "An injury can cause either the complete loss of movement and sensations or just some of them",
  "If a spinal cord injury is in the neck and the affected person cannot move any of their body parts down the neck, the injury is complete",
  "Furthermore, if they can move their body just a little bit, the injury is incomplete",
  "Based on these two considerations (location and severity), the affected person will have the following symptoms",
  "Movement loss Partial or complete loss of sensation Problems in bowel or bladder control Uncontrolled muscle contractions Trouble in breathing Intense stinging sensation Paralysis: Based on the location of a spinal injury, there are two types of paralysis",
  "Loss of sensations and ability to control movement from the neck to the rest of the body below, including both arms and shoulders is called quadriplegia; it is a very severe type of paralysis",
  "If the injury only affects the lower half of the body, it is called paraplegia",
  "Thus, if you have had an injury in the neck, don’t ignore or suppress the pain merely by taking painkillers",
  "Consult a spine specialist as soon as possible",
  "Not ensuring immediate medical care can lead to conditions of paralysis later in life",
  "Diagnosis There are various ways a doctor can examine a spinal injury",
  "Questions & Physical Examinations: The doctor will ask questions about the cause of injury, such as if you have had an accident, etc",
  "The doctor will try to evaluate the degree of loss of sensations and movements through physical assessments and techniques",
  "X-rays: This test uses X-rays to produce images of the bony parts of the body",
  "An X-ray test can help learn about the internal conditions related to the spinal bones, which are called vertebrae",
  "Vertebral fractures are major causes of most of the spinal cord injuries during traumatic events",
  "MRIs: An MRI test relies on a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed 2-D images of bones and soft tissues",
  "This test can help diagnose the extent of spinal cord injury",
  "CT Scans: Like an MRI, a CT scan also helps examine the internal conditions of the bone and soft-tissue parts of the spine",
  "Treatment There are two types of spinal cord injuries based on the nature of the origin",
  "If it is caused by a traumatic event, it is called a trauma-related spinal cord injury and otherwise, non-trauma-related spinal cord injury",
  "Based on this distinction, treatment differs",
  "The doctor can treat a traumatic spinal cord injury by methods like medications, immobilization, and surgery",
  "Medications help with swelling, inflammation, pain and other symptoms",
  "Immobilizations usually achieved through traction techniques (keeping the spine immobile in one place) and support devices like splints, braces, etc., (to stabilize the injured part while the affected person is being moved)",
  "Surgery is performed basically to relieve compressed nerves and repair damage to the surrounding structures",
  "If the spinal cord injury has originated from a non-traumatic cause like compression fractures due to osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease, tumors, infection, etc., the medical approach to treatment differs",
  "In that case, the doctor mostly focuses on preventing the injury from becoming worse and improving the quality of life with available therapies like physiotherapy, occupational therapy, mental therapies, in-home care and support",
  "Treatment length depends on the extent of the injury and other factors",
  "It is crucial to receive treatment from a medical professional no matter how long it takes and how slow the situation improves or recovery seems",
  "Conclusion the spine has several life-sustaining functions, including providing protection to the spinal cord",
  "This cord facilitates communication between the brain and the rest of the body, which is also known as the central nervous system",
  "Thus, injuries related to the spinal cord can lead to life-threatening consequences like complete paralysis and even death in the presence of extreme complications",
  "Spinal cord injuries caused by trauma are a matter of medical emergency",
  "Here, the entire focus of healthcare professionals remains on preventing the injury from becoming worse",
  "This can be achieved through immobilization techniques and surgical interventions",
  "Alongside, medications and therapies are also used to work on symptoms and improve the overall quality of life",
  "Mental health therapies might also be part of rehabilitation programmers, to help the person transition into living life with permanent disabilities with a positive outlook."
